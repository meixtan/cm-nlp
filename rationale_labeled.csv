"76 – to get 70 plus 6 equals 76, right?  So we found 5 group – um, 70 groups of 5 and then 6 groups of 5 and put them together.   Student [G] is there a problem?  Put your legs the right way under the desk and pay attention!  And Student Z, if we wanted it to be an array, one side’s 5 and one side’s 76, but it’s like we split the 76 to 70 and 6. So 5 times 70 equals 350, and 5 times 6 equals 30. Then we add them.",0
Yes Student Z.  Please wait until I call on you.  The other side we did in school on Friday.  That’s why we didn’t review it.  Sorry.  [Inaudible] how many tissues you’ve had.  Okay.  These are word problems. I made this chart because you know every day we say –what are the three things in word problems?  Does anyone know the three – the list I make over here?  Can anyone tell me one of the things on it?  Student S?,1
"Okay.  That could be your problem.  Student [G], do you have a question?  Student N, sit up.",0
"Okay.  Any other questions about this?  I need everyone listening, looking, learning, ask a question if you’re confused; heads should be up.  Boy oh boy oh! Student K.[T.], can you read number two?",0
"Okay boys and girls; I’ve said this a million bazillion times. Do not erase your work.  When you erase your work, I can’t help you because I don’t know what you did.  Do not do your work in another notebook at home because then I can’t look at it.  Do not do your 10 minute math work not in your 10 minute math notebook, okay, because I don’t know what you did now so I can’t help you.  If you show me what you did, I will. Do you understand why this makes sense Student [G]?  Okay.  Good. And we’re gonna do number three; then we’re gonna move on from homework and come back to it if we have time. But I’d rather work on more word problems.  So number three, Student A, please read.",1
You can leave yours.Take that out of your mouth please.Stop playing with it!And I’d like you to take out your swirly math notebooks.I’m going to give you right now about 5 minutes – 3 to 5 minutes – for you and your partner to write a multiplication word problem and solve it.,0
"Begin.You two will work together.Student A, can you come over here and work with Student [Z]?You two can work together; you two, you two, you two, you two, you two, you two.No, Student A is gonna come work with you.Be careful Student A with the camera when you move.",0
Why?  I already said that everyone should have a pencil. You’re telling me you’re not prepared?,0
Go get a pencil from over there!,0
"But I don’t want Student C writing it.  I want you to work together.  You’re not just writing whatever he writes. Okay?  So you need to come up together with a story.  You can change it if it’s – I don’t want to be what he picked. It can be 59 times 7, but you need to work together to come up with 59 what – what are the groups and what’s in each group, okay?  Okay Student C?  Stop playing with that and focus. What’s your story, guys?",1
"Okay, those weren’t the instructions.  So that’s disappointing.",0
"I did and I said all three of you needed to work together. Alright, well this is a problem that we also already did.",0
"You may go get it.  Student A, can you please get Student N’s folder out of her desk, and Student J, can you please turn off a light.",0
"No, no, no.You still multiplied 50 times 9, but I’m saying is we need to make the story have that make sense.If you’re waiting for me, please keep working.You can solve – you can start creating a new problem.Freeze!Please don’t talk over me.",1
"If you are done, you need to work on a brand new problem.Please don’t talk over me.Wait!Student G and Student J, please stop talking.You can work on solving a second multiplication – on solving and creating a second multiplication problem.So, you solve this still with multiplication.",1
"No.  You’re done?  For those of you – if you’re going to talk about something else, you’ll probably not have recess, just as a heads up.  No, I don’t need to hear it. Everyone freeze!  Eyes on me!  Thank you.  I know some of you are working very hard and solving the problems.  I’m coming around group to group.  Student D and Student M have finished their problem. I’m putting it on the overhead. So, if you have finished your problem and are waiting for me to see it, you may solve this one. The only problem is there’s no question mark and how can you ask a question without a question mark?  No I did.",0
So how are you – it’s okay; it’s okay.  Focus on this!  How can you solve this?  58 times 6.,0
"Great, that’s awesome.  That’s what you should be doing.  Who is waiting for me? How are you guys doing?  What do you have?  There are 37 bags and each bag has 6 apples.  How many total of apples are in all?  Now this is what we talked about before.  How can you change that last question so it makes more sense?",0
So you could say I have 5 rows – or you don’t even have to write column.  You could say I have 5 rows of cookies. There are 12 or 20 cookies in each row.  Okay?  The first one.  You don’t have a second one yet. What are you guys doing?  No what are you talking about?,0
No.  So I would like you to get back to work.,1
"That could have been.  I wish that that’s what you were talking about.  Mm hm.  Okay.  Boys and girls, raise your hand if you have finished writing and solving your first problem. Listen please boys.  Your hands should be up.  Okay.  Raise your hand if you solved Student D and Student M’s problem. Hm.  And raise your hand if you wrote a second problem for yourself.  You know what I might do?  I would like you – I’m going to type these problems up and you are going to solve them for homework.  I’m gonna type them during lunch. So, it’s time for math to end.  I would like you to leave your notebooks open onto the page where the problem is and I’d like you to pass the problems to your right so the last person in each row has a notebook that’s open.  Okay? Tonight for homework you are going to solve your classmates’ problems.  Everything else you can put away and we are going to stop.",1
"Okay, then, we're gonna have to work as pairs.  You two and you two, work in pairs.  Have a seat, dear.  Everyone else has an individual bag?  Yes?",0
"All right, scoot your chair up, sweetie.  Now, logically, when we think about something being negative, we think about it being what, good or bad?",0
"I need to see you working, sir.",0
"I need to see you working, sir.  I see a lot of hands.  This is a easy one.",0
"That was so wrong.  Okay.  Now, Student has already told us that the answer should be a negative one, which stays true to the rule of we put the sign of the number that has the greatest absolute value.  Eight had the greatest absolute value, so the sign is going to stay negative.  But then when we hop back seven spaces, have we crossed over the zero mark?  No, so we're still in negative territory.  But when we hop back on the number line from negative eight, we move back to the right seven spaces, we land up on negative one, which is our answer.  Now, how did you discover this using your counters?  How did you discover the correct answer by using your counters?  I see some people who always want to volunteer and share and then some of us who are very, very quiet.  I'm gonna come over here to Student because Student's kinda hiding back in the shadows, saying, ""Teacher, you don't see me.  If I'm really quiet, you won't call on me.""  Yes, I'm calling on you.  Did you discover that the answer was a negative one?",1
"Really?  Okay.  You with me?  Student, you with me?",0
"No.  Unless they have scuba diving gear, right?  Okay, excellent.  Thank you for being peacekeeper, dear.  One more example of how we actually need to have these negative and positive numbers.  Student?",0
"You need to mind your business, Student V, ‘cause I’m not gonna deal with you today.",1
"[Inaudible] – now.  Come back when you’re ready to not yell at people.  All right, good.  Sit.",0
"I’m – Student M, just pull the chair up and sit down.",0
You chilled out?  Here you go.,0
"Averaging group, I like how you’re working so quietly and nice.",0
Can you please look at the board before you shout out answers again?,0
"I would totally – I’d like to invite you up here, but you’re just a little too off the wall, and I don’t know why you have a marker with the cap off of it.  Student S.",1
Don’t touch those yet.  See what I mean?  You cant even sit still for two seconds.,0
"Listen ‘cause if you’re not looking, I don’t think you’re listening.  For example, I’m gonna give myself –",1
"I’m coming right now.  Do it without talking, and then when you have them – a division problem, you can write it in here. Ignore this top line, but see.  Mine would look like this. I had 8.  I had 8 and I divided it by 4, and I got 2.",0
"Student M, you’re doing this without talking.  If you don’t like the rules, you can go to your seat and do the worksheet.",0
"Student D. back up.  It’ll stop some of this mess that’s going on, but teachers you must – all staff members, you must –",1
"Just looking at it, it doesn’t seem to fit into some of the categories we've talked about.  Do you see a part of the shape that looks familiar?  Student A and Student C, let's get focused please.  Will you sit down in your chair? Okay.  We started discussing five general groups of geometric solids.  What is this an example of?  This is a cylinder.  What is this an example of?",0
"Please pay attention.  Student K, I would really like you to be able to stay here.  Can you guys work together?  This is a cube.  A cube is what kind of geometric solid?  It's not a pyramid.  It's not a cone.  It's a special kind of rectangular prism.  It is a cube, but it's a special kind of prism, a rectangular prism.  Squares are really secret rectangles in disguise.  That globe in the back of the room, what is that an example of?",0
"I want to go over some rules with these, because these are very fragile.I don’t want to send any of them back broken.I really appreciate the people who are listening, or not talking, and sitting still.Thank you very much.You'll notice that there's sort of two sides to these.",1
Back there?  Look where I'm pointing.,0
"Yeah, on the workbook page – oh, in the math room?  Let's switch please.  Come on, waiting on you.  It's written right there by the window.  Okay, group three, if you could move towards the front of the room.  Student R, what group are you in?",0
"Student C, what are you doing?",0
"I'm not saying I'm not interested in that, but what are you supposed to be doing?",0
"Then come on up please.  All right, boys and girls, can you please open up your math spiral?",0
Can you go to the office?  I don’t appreciate your attitude. You’ve already been once.  I would’ve thought you'd learned your lesson.,0
"Go, yeah.  So here's one, two, three.  I should have three more people.  Student K, you up here with us?",0
"Who are we missing?  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Student S, really?  Student A, are you here?",0
"Okay, would you please sit down and work on it.",0
You'll have to talk with Teacher C 'cause I'm working with these folks right now.,1
"What do you think?How about I hold it for you?You know what a face is?It has the one at the bottom, and if it's a hexagon, it's going to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.Please stop.I'd really like you to think about what you're doing, and if you thought about it, you'd think, ""That's kind of distracting.",1
"That's not really helping me pay attention, or you pay attention, or the people around you pay attention.Another question you're going to have to ask is what shape is the base?How do we know what the base of the pyramid is?",0
"It's just so that when they're fast forwarding through all of these videos, they can see who's who.  You know when they have a movie, and they have that little thing that's like action, cut?  Hi, Student K.  Good morning 5th graders. Welcome back.  I hope you enjoyed your lesson.  Was there many differences between the book?  I'm just interested. That's an opinion, not a fact.  You'll probably find out when you see movies and books – you probably already knew that, but they're both very different.  There's usually more detail and back story in books.  Okay.  It is now math class.  We're going to get started.  I actually really appreciate that some of you have already started.  You're working in the student reference book.  I'm also recording this for a study on effective math teaching.  That's the last one.  Please be on your best behavior.  Today we're going to be investigating properties of geometric solids. Does anybody know what a geometric solid is, or what it looks like, or anything about it?  Yes, Student E?  Thank you for raising your hand.",0
"Yeah, come on back to your math seats please.  We will have more time to finish later.",1
"Group four, you guys are back here, right?Student N, Student C, Student K, Student E, back here please.Are you with that group?",0
I asked four to start back there.  Now I don't even know what I said.  Can you guys sit down please?  I'm going to talk to group three up here.  Are you in group three?,0
"Student A, please.  You're supposed to be back there.  Could everybody please come back?  I'm going to try this one more time.  Come back.  I'm so sorry.  Maybe it was my fault.  I don't know.  Come back to your seats please.  Can you put those back in the bags please?",1
"Let's try this one more time.  So go back to your seat.  We'll try it one more time.  I'm still waiting for five people to sit down so we can get moving on this the way I planned it. So those belong back there at that yellow table with the box.  I need to take care of them because Ms. B bought them. Let's just clarify here. I'm sorry that the numbering changed from yesterday.  Group two includes all of these people here in this circle.  Student S, Student D, Student B, Student J, Student K, Student B, and Student A.  Is that clear?",1
"Tell you what.  I'm going to start with group two up at these two tables.  When we start moving, I'm going to ask you to come here.  Group four, you guys are going to be working on the workbook pages in the back of that room.  Listen.  Stop complaining and listen.  That includes Student N, Student C, Student K, Student N, and Student E.  You're going to be in the back of that room, that area I'm pointing to, and the workbook pages are posted, okay?  I would like group three to start in the back of this room.  Don't move.  The Ziploc bags and the plastic bags and nets are all going to stay in that area.  We're going to be rotating, so you're going to get there.  Please don’t worry.  Okay.  Student R, please sit down.  Raise your hand if you're going to be starting in the back of that room.  What group are you? Excuse me.  What group are you back here?",1
"Can you all quickly get where you need to be and start working? If you're with me, come to the front.  Student B, where are you supposed to be?  Get going.  You're right.  For some reason I did two, three, four, and that was a really dumb move on my part.  Thank you for pointing that out. Are you guys up here with me?",0
"No, you can leave a little bit around the edges, right?  Talk to your elbow partner about what you're doing as soon as you finish.  Good.  Okay, I like the way you're working. Let’s just go over the first two problems, the first two problems.  Go to the board for me, first two problems. Student A, first problem number one.  And number two, please number two, shade three fourths of that one, Student J.  Give yourself a little space.  You can erase.  You can use any part of the board.  How many parts do you have?  So yours is number one, Student A.  Class, read number altogether for me, please?",0
"All right.  So, today we are continuing our lesson we started a couple days ago on reflection and we are gonna be working using our reflection mirrors today to figure out some properties of reflection, and what that means.  So, we’re gonna start with slate math and then we’re gonna partner you guys up in groups and we’re gonna work on that worksheet, the back side of the worksheet that we finished the other day. Can you put this away?  Thanks.  To do slate math all you need to know is how to –",0
"Okay.  So for mental math today we are going to be reviewing dividing with decimals.  This is a skill we’ve already worked on for the past two weeks and this is just a review. So I’m gonna write on the board some problems and I’ll give you some time to work them out and then you’ll show me your answer. Think.  32 and two tenths divided by 16.  Write.  32 – I’m sorry.  35 and two tenths divided by 16.  You need to get a piece of paper.  That was the instruction.  And once again, Student W, the rolling of eyes, that’s the second time.  That’s the second time.  If you don’t have a slate, the instruction, Student D, was take out a piece of paper and a pencil.",0
"I’m sorry.  I don’t think anybody can hear you.  Student D and Student V are talking.  How do you read that decimal?  I know that she knows how to read the decimal.  How do you read the decimal?  The number on the board? [Whispering] Nobody can hear you.  Do you not know how to read the decimal and I just think you know how to read the decimal? You don’t know how to read the decimal? Okay.  I need you to use your words.  I’ve heard you speak before. So, I know that you can.  Can you read the decimal?  Yes. Can I hear the word yes ‘cause I can’t read sign language. Yes.  You just don’t want to read the decimal?  Yes or no? You know this is our math block time right now, right?",1
"Okay.  So, the longer it takes me to get words out of your mouth is the less time we have for math.  I think that’s a little unfair, especially when you clearly can speak.  Do you want some help reading the decimal?  I can’t hear you.",1
"Student A, I see your hand up but I called on Student V.  So, put your hand down ‘cause it’s rude to have your hand up when someone’s speaking and if you want to add something after Student V’s finished, I’ll come back to you.  Student V?",1
"Student Z, let go please.  I’m sorry, Student A, one second. Let go, please.  Let go, please.  It doesn’t matter how – let go.  Let go.  It doesn’t matter how many times you ball it up.  Your mom will see the same thing. [Inaudible], take a break because you’re not the teacher and I understand you’re frustrated ‘cause you’re trying to share right now, but it’s not appropriate for you to tell anybody what to do.  Can you go take a break please? Let go, please.  Let go, please.  I’m not struggling with you Student Z.  I’m not prying your fingers open.  I’m asking you to let go.  Student A, when you calm down you can come back. Can someone tell me what a reflection is?  Student V started with it has something to do with light, and it does.  What about the light?  Student S?",1
"I’m following the light to get somewhere.  Am I a reflection? No.  So I don’t think it’s something.  Can you let go, please?  Really?  I have to hold your hand?  Can you let go, please?  Okay, thank you. Student S, do you want to call on a friend to help?",0
"I can’t hear you, sweetie.  You gotta say it louder.",1
"Student A, can you get a piece of paper for [Inaudible] too? Or, Student C, can you give that piece to Student D. Here’s your paper.  On the board we have 35 and two tenths divided by 16.",0
"Yeah, a crystal could give a reflection of something.  Usually the way the light hits a crystal will give you a reflection of what?  Colors.  Right?  So you can see a reflection of certain colors based on the way the sun reflects.  Can you fix your chair, Student A?  And your desk.  Thank you. So, what we’re gonna do as a quick activity to sort of put into practice all of the things that we just talked about in terms of reflection is, I’m gonna partner-pair you up.  And we’re gonna have like two minutes to do it. So, one partner is gonna pretend that they are a mirror.  So they strike a pose.  And the other partner will then strike the same pose.",0
"All right.  So, Student D and Student S, go ahead and partner up.  Student W and Student J, go ahead and partner up. Student A and Student W, go ahead and partner up.  Student K and Student A partner up.  Student J and Student E partner up.  Student S and Student A partner up.  You and Student C partner up.  And can you partner with [Inaudible]?  Thank you.  So if you got a partner, you go stand next to your partner.  Student V, you don’t have a partner.  I’ll be your partner. All right.  So, if you’re a one, actually the student who is the shortest of the partner pair gets to go first.",0
"So you’re the partner who gets to go.  So, you’re gonna strike a pose and then I have to mimic you.  So, partner who’s the shortest should be doing something.  Not a movement but a pose.  The second partner should be then copying, pretending that your partner is the mirror.  So you need to be able to do or move in a way that is exactly the same. [Inaudible], you gotta move close to your partner.  Go ahead.  You have to do the same thing.  There you go! Student J, are you starting?  You guys can start.",0
All right.  Then switch.  Are you mimicking exactly what I’m doing?  ‘Cause my hand is on my hip.,0
Where?  I can’t hear you.  Please speak up and stop mumbling.,0
"No.  So, Student V, raise your hand right?  And then when I call on you, you can comment.  But what I’m gonna say right now is then is a shadow and a reflection the same thing?",1
"As soon as you raise your hand quietly, that’s when you get called on.  Quiet hands.  Student C?",0
Can you sit up?  Why are you sitting like that?,0
"[Inaudible], stop.",0
"Once you use your reflection mirror, pass it to someone else. So, look at the bottom of 291.  Can you read the words at the bottom of the page?",0
"Student A, when you’re done looking at it, can you pass it to someone else?  We’re short on mirrors and not everyone has one.  Student J, has it.  [Inaudible], where’s your math book?",1
"Go get it, please.  Open up your book.  Thanks.",0
"What you need to have with you, those worksheets that have the dog on the backside.  You need to have one mirror.  So, if you are with a partner who already has a mirror at their desk, you don’t need to bring another one.  You also need a pencil.  This transition should take you less than ten seconds.  I’m gonna count down to ten.  By the time I get to ten, you need to have your paper, a mirror, a pencil and a seat next to the person you’re working with.  Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. You had ten seconds.  Student A, who’s your partner?",1
"Who?  Sweetie, all you have to do is walk to the seat.  Did anyone hear me say bring your math journal?",0
No.  I never said bring your math journal.  I said bring the paper that has the dog on it.  Have a mirror with you and a pencil.  Raise your hands if you were able to follow that direction?  You have a math journal with you.  You weren’t able to – you have a math journal with you.  You were not able to follow that direction.,1
"And I said use the same partner pair.  So, can you please move your chair next to Student A?  Put down the mirror ‘cause the only thing you need to bring with you was one paper, one paper, a pencil and a chair.  He has a mirror.  Thank you. Everyone together.  Great! All right.  We have 15 minutes for you guys to get through this activity.  This is the independent practice part.  You all need to put the recessed edge of the mirror on the line next to the picture. So, everyone needs to turn their papers over.  You should see a picture of a dog.  The recess, that’s the side – well, who can tell me which side is recessed?  Which side?  Student V?",0
There’s a desk in between you two.  It’s hard for me to understand why you guys can’t work out this problem.  Which side is the – Student Z?  Student Z?  Student Z?  The problem is I’m talking.  I’m in the front of the room. Your back is to me.  So you’re clearly not listening to anything that I’m saying. I’m behind you.  Stop trying.  That’s your problem.  You’re not listening.  Because you have your mirror on the wrong side. This is why I’m trying to help you figure out how to do it. Which side is the recessed side?  You are so trying.  Student D?,1
"Yeah.  You see this side that has that little ridge that’s like indented a little bit which is at the top of yours?  It should be on the bottom of the page.  Yep.  So, everybody put the recessed side on the bottom of the page. Can you all show me that that’s what you can do.  The recessed edge – [Inaudible], did I ask you to draw anything?  Nope. Student J, did I ask you to draw anything?",0
"Did I ask you to draw anything?  If you’re drawing right now, you’re not following directions and I know you didn’t follow the direction two days ago.  And you’re still drawing.",0
"Student S, why are you over here if your partner’s over there?",0
"Please go back.  You guys really need to start following directions.  We’re at the end of fourth grade and you guys still can’t follow basic directions.  It’s hard.  I can’t even get through this simple activity.  It should take two minutes to explain.  We’ve wasted five minutes already. Student K, go take a break.  Stop drawing, please.  Go take a break.  That means you have to get up and go sit in a – take a break, [Inaudible], and think about following the direction.  Thank you. Wow! When you look directly through the mirror, you should see the image of the dog’s head.  It’s best to look through the mirror at the same level as the mirror.  So that means you gotta bend your head down and look through the mirror. Student C, go take a break.  I’ve asked you to stop drawing and you’re still drawing.  So, take a look at the dog through the mirror.  I want you to carefully draw the image of the dog head on the paper the way you see it and where you see it on or through the mirror.",1
Why is he drawing – where’s your paper?,0
"Well, Student S, that makes sense.  Why are you letting him draw on your paper?  Wow! All right, if you’re done drawing because you’ve already – and Student S, you don’t have a paper.  Student A, sit down please.",0
Sh! Student A?,0
"Look through the mirror.  That’s important.  There was no way for you to see the reflection if you didn’t look through the mirror.  Thumbs up if everybody agrees with that. Okay.  So you know you have to look through the mirror to see the reflection. Okay.  How are the two drawings alike?  How are the two drawings alike, Student J?",1
"Didn’t we draw the same shape?  So we have a semi-circle, maybe an oval, and a circle for the nose.  We curved the head. So we have the same shape, the same size.  Student D, sit up for me. What’s different about them?  What’s different about them?  You gotta look at your paper.  Yes?  Student Z, what’s different about those dogs?",0
"I see right side on this side and I see left side on the other side.  It’s reversed.  For instance, put your hand down. Student A, come stand up.  Student Z, your back is to me the entire time.  You’re not learning if you’re not paying attention. If Student A and I are standing here, let’s pretend we’re the same person.  You see this side of his body.  What side is this?",0
"You gotta draw it on the other side, Student A.  You gotta draw it on the other side.  Yeah, I see your hand.  I’m not interested in you going to the bathroom right now.",0
"You should draw it.  Stop writing your name, sweetie.  Measure – all right.  What’s the measurement?",0
"I know, sweetie, but you weren’t paying attention.  I said measure to the reflection line.",1
"The same.  The distance – you need to know these properties in order to get into lunch.  Please close your books.  Hold onto these papers.  We’re gonna use them again.  Please move back to your seat.  Move your chairs back to where they belong.  If you have lunch in your cubby, go get your lunch.",1
"Student E, stay on the same path.",0
"Okay.  Student E, come sit next to me.  Student H, stop talking to her, okay?  Or come sit next to me.  You’re not being helpful if you’re just talking to her.  She needs to understand.  I’m gonna help her do that.  Very good.",1
"Subtract.  Student A, lower your voice.  Lower your voice. Student A, if you can’t work in a group at the appropriate volume, then you won’t work in groups, you’ll work independently.",0
"Student K, switch seats with Student D, you know you’re not to sit next to Student A.",1
"Joining process.  You’re gonna find it all of them.  And, you’re gonna say which one is the faster.  Okay, so you need to write four here.  Correct.  You know how to divide, and bring your decimal point up.  Whoa.  What just happened with the volume in the Student T?  What just  happened to the volume in this room?",0
"All right, I’m looking for Student A, A, H, A, A, and M.  We need to be back where we should be – what?",0
"Hold on, I’ll be right with you, page 337, please.  It’s 337. Excuse me, let me say this again.  Everyone may freeze – We are not talking in our outside voices – we’re working independently, because I asked you not to talk.  I asked you not to talk. You’re not talking.  So-",1
"In appropriate classroom voices, everyone is speaking in a whisper because the folks in your group will hear you.  So, let’s go ahead and get started.  These folks here, they’re starting with a multiplication exercise.  It is time.  Four minutes is on the timer, you need to press start.  Stop talking, I’m giving you four minutes.  As soon as I stop talking, you may begin.  You have four, just that side. You have four minutes to fill out as much of the chart as you chart.  Hopefully, you’ll finish it.  If not, we’ll see.  We’re gonna check for accuracy.  Also, too, after that, you’re gonna be moving to -- You guys can work on division, and then when you’re done with that, you’re gonna go ahead and move onto area, which is the next sheet.  These folks over here, you’re working on Oder of Operations – guys, one, two, three, go.  All right, shift it back.  You guys moved a whole table group over.",1
"Thank you, Student A, say it again?",0
"Good.  So, what are the quantities involved?  Please have a seat, please have a seat.",0
"Follow along the table, you can’t keep adding. You can’t keep adding.  It’s gonna take too long.  Come on, are you solving or are you just talking?",1
"37 cents per – okay, we’re working right now, so excuse me? Stop talking about things that don’t have anything to do with math.  Okay, number three, a store sells a four pack of AA batteries for $2.00 – oh, I’m sorry, one pound of slice turkey and one palm is equal to – read the whole thing.",0
"You’re looking at two different problems.  When I’m looking like this.  We’re too loud in these two table groups.  At the blue math rotation map.  And, the green math rotation. Please, lower your voices.   No.  None.  How many can go into 64?  How many times do you think?  Try not to.",1
"At the end of our time together, we’re gonna go ahead and turn our materials in.  As you know, what we get done during this time depends, well tell who’s going to recess and who’s not.  Who’s got to sit and finish their work.  I don’t have my whistle.  So, go ahead and do, move to your first rotation.  If you are with me, at concept inquiry, the red table, we are working in our math journal, volume two, on page 337.",1
"Go ahead.  Guys, we’re not gonna do that.  We’re not gonna do this hard one.   Excuse me, guys at the blue table.  You are too loud.  Put your bottoms in your seats and use your inside voices.  Student J, I love that you’re speaking to Student W.",1
"Stay focused, ladies and gentlemen, we’ve got about 10 minutes remaining.  Half your time’s up.  And I’m gonna be checking work from your blue folder before we proceed to recess. So, make sure you’re doing what you need to do.  Bring the decimal up.  Student J, did you get out of your seat, without permission.",1
"Right, because you need to go work with your group.  That’s why you’re in a group.",1
"Sit down.  Student J, you’re working with the group.  If you can’t work with a group, then you’re – well, you’re sitting out of recess.  Okay, you guys are – then why do some of you have it written down, and others don’t.  She was ___ together.  Together.   Help each other.",0
"Student K?  Come sit over here a second.  Come over here. Because now you affecting other people, and preventing them from finishing.",1
"You shouldn’t even have to set that up.  Because it’s the basic math, bringing in decimals.  And, I’m gonna write her mom and tell her that she needs to make anything you participate in or do on the weekends, contingent.  Alex, Alex?  We need t have a serious conversation.",1
"Now, multiply the cost per ounce by the number of ounces to find out how much – 14 times.  Student M?  All right, we have about three minutes remaining, three minutes remaining.  We’re do our final rotating.  Please, sit down. I’m working with a group.  We’ll do our final rotation when we return from lunch.  Student W,  please stop talking when I’m talking.  And, quiet, Student W.  And, at that time, we will finish talking about this and do our wrapup. But, for now, we need to get some lunch.  And, what I need from all of you if for you to put your work into your folder.  I need you to tuck your work into your folder, and when I call you up from the line I need you to present me with your completed work.  All right?  Thank you.",0
"We divide.  So, the first thing I want you to do is to underline the quantities that you’re dealing with.  Good. 15 ounces and $3.60.  So, we’re gonna divide.  Let’s do that now.  Let’s set up the problem first of all.  Boys and girls, we’re a little too noisy.  At the converge, at the computation table.  Okay, so now that we, okay, Student T set it up correctly.  Student D.  No, don’t show him, let him do it.",0
How on one second.  Can everybody hear Student A?,0
"Guys, we’re really loud.  You’re really loud.  We should be in our whisper voices.  I’ll be right back.  I need to tell them the same thing.",0
Good.  You’re too loud.,0
"What I’m seeing is not good.  And, I mean, you can keep on top, and just stay in your seat.  But, if you can’t do that, then unfortunately, you’re gonna have to go to the ______. Boys and girls --",0
"Excuse me, you guys are way too loud.  Student D, whisper.",0
"60 percent.  And how did you figure that out, Student N? Listen up, guys, this is important stuff.  How did you know that 3/5 was 60 percent?  What was the first thing in your head that led you to get to that point?  Did you start by figuring out a fraction that was even smaller?",1
"Go ahead.  Close the door behind you.  We have that sign on the door, okay? You got it, Student N?",1
"So, okay, Monday, Tuesday and Friday would have worked.  But you’re right, there’s only one combination of two days, Wednesday and Thursday.  Nice work, guys.  Turn this page over, we have one more to do, and then we’re going to start our math. All right.  No, this is it, we have one more to do, guys, and then we’re moving on.  You should be on page 14.  It should be Miguel’s Fruit Salad Recipe.  Before you start, quick question.  What is 100 percent, raise your hand.  Student P, can you put that away please?  What is 100 percent of the total number of kids in our class?",0
"We don’t use those words, do we?",0
"Write 60 percent next to that.  It’s 60 percent of one quart, right, because these are coming to you in quarts.  2/3, can you convert that to percent?  Remember it all starts with doing 1/3, doesn’t it?  Write down 1/3, what it is percent wise.  Off over here.  I’ll be right back. You guys need another minute?  Raise your hand if you’re done. You’re done?  You’ve got to sit up straight in your chair. You’ve got the right idea, you should be combining these. Okay, now wait a second, what are you doing there?  Oh, you had it, you wrote 66 and 2/3.  Because 1/3 equals 33-1/3.  Rewrite that again, I’m sorry, I shouldn't have erased that.  You have 60 percent, 66-2/3 percent.  Obviously you know what a fourth is, write that one in.  Is it 20 percent?  I thought that was a fifth.  What’s a fourth? Student H, I haven’t called on you yet today, have I?  I guess you know what that means.  That means I’m going to call on Student J. Okay, so how much is a fourth, how many percent?  We know a fourth is a half of a half, and we know a half is how many percent?",1
"500 percent.  So percents is per 100, right?  And what I did is since I put these fractions into one-hundredths, then what I can do is I can just add them all together, right Student S? Student S.  Tell me how I’ll know if I can fit them in the bowl.  I don’t want to keep on giving this up.  How will I know if it will fit in the bowl, and how will I know if it won’t fit in in the bowl?  Or should I call on Student H now? We’re going to get Student H slide on this one today, we’ll get her next time.  Student S, why don’t you finish it off, because you started us off great. Sit up please.  Student P, sit down please.  Thank you.",1
"All right, we still have some work to do with this.  What we’re going to do is, we’re going to do in between for the next 15 minutes till we switch.  So but these in your math folders, break into your partners that are sitting at the tables with you.  Student D, I want you to work with the people that are right across from you.  Student D and Student A, I want you to go to the round table in the back and have Student N be your partner.  Everybody get their decks of cards, okay?  In between, if you need a set of copies on the rules, they’re up here on the table. I think everybody’s good with it though.",1
"We can do that in between, that’s fine.   Once you get your deck of fraction cards, guys, you can go ahead and get your snacks too.  And then if everybody wants to turn to the camera and say thank you?   Thank you!",1
"Can someone go – Student B, go find Student J.  Tell him I",0
"How are you going to show your work?  That's the game today. How are you going to show your work?  That's why you're together.  You're going to work together and compare your answers.  You have one.  This is fine.  That's exactly what the question's asking you.  Go sit down, and raise your hand.  How many miles did they drive all together?  So they started here.  They drove from here.  They went to there. How many miles did it take them to get there?  And the after they stopped there, they drove here.  How many miles is this and that?  Yes.  How many miles did they drive all together from Virginia Beach, to New York City?  Good job. That I don't really understand.  What are you showing me with that?",0
"Okay.  You either need to make this bigger and spread it out, or do it on another piece of paper, but that's a little – keep going.  Let me see how you do it.  You need to raise your hand please.  Go back to your seat and raise your hand, and who are you working with?  It's Student S, so you should be working with Student N, okay?  Student T, [inaudible].  Can you read what this is asking you, this one?  Do you know what it's asking you?  All right.  I want you to read it.  Do this one with Student N, and do this one together just in case any of the words get crossed off.",0
"18 and 19.  You're working alone?  You can work with Student J and Student K.  Do you know what to do for that one?  Go work with Student J and Student K, please.  Student G, I'm sorry.  Why are you out of your seat right now?  If you have a question, you sit down and raise your hand.  When I looked up at you, you were playing with your pencil and goofing off with Student R and Student G.  What is your question?  What is this question asking you?  Read the question.  Right here, read this.",1
"No.  Just do it the one time.  That's fine.  You can do it twice.  Go ahead.  What are you playing with now?  Nothing? You're doing this together.  Can you read this with him? Because his is all broken off.  You have four more minutes, and then – you know what the rest of your homework is, right?  Okay.  So it's day one of your spelling, ABC order three times each, your sketches, and your Charlotte's Web.",1
"Five times 30 equals – can you shut that door, Student B? Student F, can you help Student J, five times 30?",0
"Good job.  Okay.  So number one, can someone read for me in a nice, booming voice, number one?  Student K, read number one for us.",0
"Okay.  They traveled 427 miles, and then continue, Student K. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry Student K, but this group, these two groups right here are being extremely rude.  You're following along.  Continue.",0
"You did – oh, so you did – Student R, please stop with the noises.  It's distracting.  Did you do a timeline?  How did you do it?",1
"200 plus 160 plus 6 – I'm sorry.  Two boys, I just changed your numbers, and yet you're talking.  Student J, it's not time to say hello to your friends.  Here.  Just take this pile. 200 plus 160 plus 6 equals—",1
"I'm sorry, but Student M's reading.  You're paying attention to this lesson.  I don't care who's outside the door, okay? The behavior, and the movement, and the distractions is a little too much today.  So how far is it from New York City, to where was she going?",1
"632, good job, miles.  So now I want to see if you can tell me which – Student E, you can go to the bathroom.  Which week was the shortest amount of travel?  Student K?  Week two, 366 miles.  What was the longest week?",0
"14 times 32.  How did you find it?  I don't know that for a fact.  How'd you find it?  Let's break up both of them, 10, 4, 30 and 2.  10 times 30 equals – Student G, why are you talking right now?  Okay?  We're up here.  10 times 30 is?",0
"Oh.  That's right.  It's eight.  It's 120.  I'm thinking it's 80.  There we go, 448.  Good job, Student E.  Excuse me. That's not how we behave.  I realize it's after recess, but you need to calm down.  You're looking at your map on the back of page 15, so it's page 16 and it should look like this.  Who does not have a map?  Take one, leave one for Student G.  Does everyone have a map back here?  Today we're going to continue to solve addition problems about car trips, okay?  So here's the map.  This is part of the United States where the Jones family lives.  What do you know about this part of the United States?  What part of the United States is this?  Student B?",1
"Student M, no.  You need to control.  I don’t want to hear oohs and ahs.  You're not a monkey here.",1
"All right.  I'm going to talk to him about that.  So you are going to solve these problems about the Jones's family car trip.  Show your solutions so someone else can understand how you solved the problem.  Before you get started, what are some ways you can show – oh wait.  Student A, put the ruler away.  You're not using it.  You don't need it.  No. Away.  What are some ways you can show how you solved these problems?  What's one way, Student G?  So these are addition problems.  How are you going to show how you solved it?",1
"Your timeline.  So you are working on questions one, two, and three, and you will have 15 minutes to work with your partner quietly.  I want you to discuss it.  Read the questions together.",0
"Looking at me.  I'm going to Student S and  student S back there on the table.  Yeah, a little bit.  All right boys and girls, hands down.  Student S over on that side please. Sh.  Everyone’s looking at me.  Now today for math we are going to be learning about geometric shapes.  Now on our last book we studied some geometric shapes.  They were in Polly Polygons.  Who remembers what some of those shapes were?  Our geometric shapes.  I just so happen to have a bag of Polly Polygons here.  Student R?",0
"Count them with your partner.  Say to your partner, “Here’s my shape.  Here’s my shape.  Let’s count together where the faces are, where the edges are, where the vertices are.” So you and your partner should have the same number.  On this paper that you're getting you are putting your name on it. On the first paper you're not.  Student L? So you're putting your name on it so we know and then we’ll get with our partners and I’ll give you your bag of shapes.  And you're going to be going with Mr.  C, so you're — when the big hand’s on the five, okay?  No?  Oh, Student G, you got to be sitting until I get you with your partner.  All right, I am waiting for us to get with partners.  If you feel you know who you want for a partner, stand please. Who?",1
"Student E.  Student E is — oh, that’s her instrument.  You can put it right under there, dear.  We’ll start with Student R.  Student M would you move please?  Student S, Student M. Take your things with you.  You need a pencil and your two papers.  Student N?  Oh, you don’t know?  Student R?",0
"Oh, Student S, we’re finding our shapes.  Take your shape out. Eyes up here.  Only take one shape out at a time.  The first shape is a cube.  Only take your cube out.  One at a time and then put it on your desk.  Is there any group that doesn’t have a bag?  Student M, you're working with your partner.  Yeah, but I asked you to wait in the room.  So just wait right there.  He should be here any minute. Quietly.",1
"Oh, I like how some groups are working.",0
"Student E, you need a pencil.",0
"No, you did one but wait a minute, you’ve got one different than here.  Take out the cube.  You're doing them together. You only take out the — put all the rest back.  So, Student N, you said how many faces were there?",0
"Okay, please don’t — she’s not just copying.  She’s got to know what each word is.  I don’t want you---these are the faces, the flat surfaces.  Stand in the hall.  These are the faces.  These are the — the next one is the vertex.  Vertex are the points.  And the edges are these between the faces. All right?  So you all have to count.  You can’t do all the work.  They have to do some too.",1
Then you should be listening.  Formula for area.  Student V?,0
"I’ll be with you in a minute.  You may use mine but you're not mixing your set.  I want it back.  You may use it.  I want it back.  Would you go to the science lab and see if Mr.  C is there?  He might not be.  Go.  Oh, we’re not playing with the shapes.  I've said that before.  Is he there?  I'm going to ask you to come in.  You know what to do.  Sit down.  I'm going to give you this bag of shapes.  You are not to fool around.  You know what the shapes are and you're to write in how many faces and how many edges. Okay, any group need help?",0
"Please don’t bang the shape.  When you're done with that shape, put it up here.  Go on to your next shape.  Your next shape is a what?",0
This is ridiculous.  You have no recess either today.,0
So the rectangle.  Face.  You see.  Stay in your seat.  Student S?,0
I don't know what you're doing but stay with your partner.,0
Are you almost done?  You're skipping around.  Please act like the fourth grade.  You're skipping all around.  I don’t like it.  She’s doing them pretty much in order.  Yours is big mess.,0
You're not.  You are on camera.  Knock it off or you will have no recess.,1
"Play what?  You're being taped.  Oh, I shouldn’t see our shapes rolling around.  Hang on to them.  Yeah, the round one you might want to put back in your bags so it doesn’t roll around.",1
"I'm going to suggest next time we do partners, do not, Student N, do not ask to be his partner.  I will say no.  You do not work well together.",1
"Twelve.  A lot of people got eight but then you forgot to count, Student V, these four on the sides.  So there are twelve.  If you did not have those figures in, correct your paper, erase, put in the correct figure.  Let’s put that back in our bag, that shape, Student A.  And right now we are looking for the square pyramid.  Just the square pyramid out.  Student S’s group, ready?  Student E, you don’t have this out.  Put those away.  Just this one. Square pyramid.  I'm waiting for Student M’s group. Student G’s group.  Here we go.  Student S, what did you get for faces?",0
"Twenty-four and everyone take out your cylinder.  Cylinder. Just the shape cylinder.  Student J, let Student E hold this one.  Let her hold it.  All right, eyes up here.",0
"This is — kind of looks like the cube a little bit.  Student M, are you ready?  I'm going to start with Student E.  Will you do this one for me?  Student E, you have the shape — sh, Student V.  You have this shape.  You're telling me how many faces.  Can’t hear you.",0
"Edges are these things here.  There’s four on this side, four on this side, and then there are more edges on the top. Now we’re guessing.  Student N?  How many edges?  Cannot hear you.  Sh.  How many?",1
"Student N, are you listening?  I hope so.  You're looking at me.  You're not looking at him.  Student M, again?",0
"Just, oh quiet, raise hands, quietly.Let me see.Let’s try Student G.",0
"Student M, would you help her with the shape?  How many faces? Hexagon — wait a minute.  Hexagon we said there are six sides.  So you’ve got to count all of these on top and the two on the bottom.  We’ll wait for a few minutes for you to do.  How much?",0
"Twelve is correct and Student E, how many edges?  Well, please do it now.  If you know there are six on the top and six on the bottom and there are six in the middle, how many is that?  You have your shape in your bag.  Student S, please put all the shapes away except this.  So Student E, will you count them please?  There are six — we said there were six sides on this side.  We are counting the edges. Everyone of these — Student E, look at me.  Student D, you're right in the way.  Please sit.  Every — every — losing my voice.  Every one of these is six.  Every one of these of six.  Every one of the top is six.  What is six times three?",0
"What did he say, Student S?  Didn't hear because you were talking.  Who heard?",0
"Okay.  I want you to just very quietly at your group talk about what you wrote down.  If you didn't have anything written down, add something to your paper that one of your friend's says.  It might not be true.  We're going to find out. Student S, [inaudible] at your group.  Anybody here think they know all of the words?  Student L, do you know all of them?  Did you share with Student J and Student L and everybody?  Okay.  Well make sure they hear something too if they don't hear all of them.  Okay.  This is what I want you to do next.  Take your pencil and put it inside your desk.  We will use it again some more, but right now I just want them out of your hands.  You too, Student S.  Okay. Student J said that he had seen some of these things in money, right?  So Student J, if you saw this, what part of that would be one of these words?  The decimal?  The decimal point?  Tenths, hundredths?",1
"Okay.  He's right.  This little dot is called a period when it's at the end of a sentence, but when it's in a number we call it a decimal point.  This is a place that you would see a decimal point in real life.  This whole number, this is called a decimal number because it has a decimal point in it.  Student J, if you'll turn around and face the front, it's going to be easier to learn this.  You need to be watching.  Student J said that tenths and hundredths had something to do with place value.  Does anybody have any idea in this $2.38 which part of that might be something to do with tenths?  What do you think, Student C?  What?",1
"We're going to sort some of the things that are the same, together.I'm going to ask you to use them in a certain way today.I'll use Student M's package.I want everybody to take their manipulatives and push them to the top of your desk.",1
"Expanded form.  So we could write this out in expanded form. In expanded form it would be the same as saying 60 plus 4, and then plus one tenth.  Look how you make a one tenth. The best thing to do is to show a zero, to show there's zero ones, and then a decimal, and then a one.  This is what I want you to do next.  Pack up all your materials. Let's see which group can do that fastest.  Have one person from your group pick up the packages and go put them [inaudible].  Let's see which group will be first.  Student M's group is almost finished, right there.  Student N's group is almost finished.  Okay.  Here's what I want you to do next.  Ready?  We're going to practice writing some numbers in decimal form.  Looks like Student M's group was done first.  Student M, Student J.  Thank you, Student J. On your paper we're going to practice writing some numbers. The first number that I want you to write is a fraction, okay?  So somewhere below what you've written already, write the fraction one tenth.",0
"Those little tiny pieces that we had, we'd have to have 100 of those to make one square, so this is how you would write it as a fraction.Try it as a word.Write it on your paper.One one-hundredth.I will come to you if you raise your hand after you write it.",0
"You need to think of the things that it's not, also.Okay.Take out your workbook, and we're going to practice writing decimals and fractions to go with pictures.Take out your workbook.Go to page 94.Student J, do you need to go out to stay?Page 94.",0
"He can’t move today.  Remember the chart over there.  Student J is finding it a good idea to use his measurement chart on the back wall. Hi, good morning.  I guess quickly take your seats.  We’re just starting on page 61.  The kids next to you will get you started. So you’re probably – you can get that.  You’re probably again – I’m gonna remind you – you want to use the chart on the back wall if you can’t remember the unit conversions that we were working on last week.  So I think that you’ll find it in here.",0
"Very good.  Student A, Student A?  Good morning.  Okay, take your stuff off!  Open up your math binder please. So over here I should see you working.",0
"I like the way I see Student J making a chart.  She’s visualizing – just minute Student N; let me finish passing this out.  I like the way as I walk around I see Student [E] choosing to break apart numbers, to decompose that 36. Here you go. So the only conversation I should be hearing is you working with your partners.  Your name and date should be on your sheet. So, over here, this is a yardstick, Student E, okay?  In a yardstick there are 36 inches.  And that’s what this problem is telling you.  This is – when they talk about a yard, this is what they mean.  Okay?  And this question says how many inches are in 8 yards?  So many inches are in this year? What did I tell you?  In this yard, how many?",0
"Times.  So 8 times 36; very good.  And then you can work out that solution.  Okay? Student A, you need to take your stuff off please.  Student J, take off your jacket.  You’ve been in a few minutes. So when I see people thinking about a yardstick, reminding yourself that this is a yardstick.  Well this is a meter stick, but I’m covering the yards.  So, in this problem, what am I trying to figure out in number one?  I’ve asked you a question over here.",1
I mean I told you yesterday.  Oh it doesn’t matter; it doesn’t matter.  Okay.  I told everyone we’re starting the video right after – [sometime later]. Okay.  I went to the other tables.  I don't know if you guys saw –,0
"Oh, 36 times 4 plus 36 times 4 would be awesome; love it.  So that’s this strategy here Student C, breaking apart in some other way.  Yeah. Okay.  You need to take your jacket off.  You’re on film and you need to start.  Okay?  It’s okay.  I know you’re late but it’s alright.  Just take a deep breath and we’re starting by reading this and making sense of it.  We started our conversation thinking about multiplication strategies from yesterday.  Once you get your equation, remember that one that worked really well yesterday was this one for you. Break the numbers by place value.  Okay?  So once you get started and write your equation – Student S, I want to remind you; this is the strategy Student S that worked really well for you yesterday; finding the place of each number and keeping your other factor the same.  So get right to work. So you guys are ready for step two and step three and your tools are in the middle.  And I’ll be there to check your work.",1
So we’re gonna get started on our multiplication today.  So we have two ultimate goals.   The first goal is to use the words “factor” and “multiple” correctly.  So we have our assessment on Friday.  We started the unit like this.  So who can raise their hand and identify what the factor is and what the multiple is?  And I’ll help everybody out. Student E?  Nice and loud.,0
"I think that you’re a little stuck and I want to help you.Okay.Bring this to the guided reading table and I’ll help you.I’ll be right there.Okay.Can you come to the guided reading table please?If you’re done with all three, you can move onto the games.",1
"Good.  So this is the factor that won’t change.  So now you have a 30 and a 6, instead of the larger 36, times 8. So when I look out at the class right now, I see a lot of people that I will be giving miles to at the end of math.  Student C, you’re listening to my voice for a minute.  At the end of math, you know you’ll be getting miles if you’re work is done; you have three steps to do.  I don’t expect you to get to both array games, maybe do one of – half – like one call of one and half of the other.  But I don’t expect you to fool at your tables.  The array games are a chance for you to continue to practice your work around multiplication and breaking up numbers, thinking about division, missing factors, and how division is related to multiplication. It’s not a chance to fool around.  If I talk to you, your name will be on your weak side and we will need to discuss it.  It’s not okay for me to be interrupted. Yes Student [A].",1
"Girls, please remember what I said about all the whispers. So I like that you guys are trying to figure out 6 times 8.",0
"Student [J], I’m just watching him to make sure that you have that relationship between division and multiplication.  You were doing some chatting and laughing over here, so I want to make sure that you’re on track.",1
"So I’m gonna let you think about that and work that one out. Alright, let’s come together to share.  Can you put all array cards away and open back up to 61?  Can you guys put all array cards away?  It’s time to share.  Open back up to page 61. Okay?  It’s time to put all array cards away.  Student J and Student A, figure out – keep working on that problem while they clean up quickly.  Perfect.",0
"Excellent. You should be cleaning up like Student J, Student M.  I’d like everyone to clean up and Student [E], and please open back up to page 61.  And I’d like you to be more respectful to him please. I like what I see from Student T.  You can put your game sheet in section four – or actually, just put it right next to your work today.  That’s okay.",0
"There’s gonna be a label there of weeks; there days.  It’s perfect there.  It’s just perfect.  Can you guys work a little harder and clean up faster please.  Miles don’t get passed out to people that are talking while cleaning.  You understand what you need to do, but you’re not doing it; and that’s a poor choice.  Student M, you’re going over to your weak side and hopefully it’s a fast visit. Anyone not cleaning quietly is moving over to their weak side. Hopefully it’s a fast visit.  You should be cleaning up.",0
You can put it right next to the sheet; that’s okay.  You should be cleaning up.  This should be in your binder.,0
"You have 30 seconds.20 – you have 10 – 20 seconds left, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.Times up.So I hear whispering at one table.If they are whispering, they are not getting the 500 miles.He doesn’t have time to clean now.",1
"He didn’t get the time done in time.Alright; everyone was asked to open to page 61.If you missed that direction, can you open back up to 61?Thank you for making it a fast visit Student M.  You should be open to page 61.That should not be out.",0
Explain to me what that looked like.Eyes should be right up here.Your ears are listening.,1
"100.  Thank you.  Student [G] honey, he’s sharing.  How did you get that Student T?",1
"And put that zero here.  So thinking about this picture, if this were a 10 – Student A, eyes up here – if this were a 10, in stretching out the 10 – 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, okay?  And 8 times 5 equals –",0
"Let’s read it.  Who highlighted the question?  Student [M] and Student [G], you need to stop.  Who highlighted the question?  So Student M, read us what it said.",0
"Yeah, go ahead, you separated – can you not play with papers here?  It’s distracting and it’s making the noise being heard.  You should be open to page 61.  Okay.  Student [A], go ahead and speak.",1
Your eyes should turn to Student [A].  That’s the class rule.,1
Your eyes should be turning to Student [E]; he’s the person speaking.,1
Can I have this so I can turn it in please?  You’re on camera now.,1
"You’re going down to the office.  Let’s go.  I’m not gonna play games with you, Student J.  I asked for the envelope now please.",1
You have until three to pass it in my hand.  One –,0
Three.  Pass the envelope to me and put it on my desk.,0
"Student N?  Thank you.  Boys and girls, I want to remind you. When somebody is sharing, you do not belong drawing on your notebooks.  You belong looking at the child speaking.  It’s unacceptable to do anything other than that. Student [E], speak in a louder voice.  All eyes should be on him.  Go ahead.",0
"Okay.  Can I ask you to do something for me?  Can you look at how Student [A] showed it and ask yourself is there anything different?  It’s important to listen to your classmates, okay? Alright.  I’m gonna ask a question.  Did anybody try to find an equivalent problem?  Student N, your eyes should be on me please.  You did?  Alright Student A.  What do you think? Loud and clear.  Everyone’s eyes on here.  This is the strategy that I was really hoping someone would give a shot.  Go ahead.",0
"So now we had stretched it out to 20 rows, okay?  And as Student [E] had said, 6 times 10 is 60.  And I’ve got ten 6’s here.  Alright.  So it’s okay to understand what Student N was saying because that’s how we come into this. We see it like that.  We’re putting a zero here.  But, as far as the math that goes into that, remember that we’re stretching out this number 10 times.  Alright. So one of the strategies you can use today is breaking up the number in any way.  Another strategy is breaking up the numbers by place.  Student J, your eyes should be up here please.  So why did I say breaking it up by place when you look at this?  How do you know that’s by place?",0
"Okay?  And then the final way – I think Student J might have been the only one that explored this and I explored it a little bit.  But this is that strategy that, if you’re really feeling comfortable breaking up numbers, this is one to look for.  I know that I watched Student J and she does look at numbers.  Student J, your head should be up please. I know Student J looks at numbers and she finds the double a lot.  And that’s one of the strategies that she uses to break up numbers.  And, in this situation, we were able to find the double of 30 and what of 16?",0
"Okay.  Student C, since you called it out?  Two.  You guys agree?",0
"Hmm, [Inaudible].  Okay, you answered his question. All right, then we have [Inaudible] [Inaudible] numerator and what is our denominator?  Check it and see [Inaudible] Did you check and see if it’s correct?  Did you take that mixed number and change it into an improper fraction to see if it’s correct?  Did you check it? Do I have anyone that’s still having some trouble?  If you’re still having some trouble, raise your hand.  Student T, can you step over there – over by Student R and help her out, see what she’s doing wrong?  Who’s still having – anyone else still having trouble?  Okay, Student L, I saw yours. Excuse me, Student L.  Can you step over here by Student L? You’re having some trouble?  Did you check it?  You must check it to see if it’s correct, okay?  [Long pause] Okay.  Good job, Student L.  Thank you for using the correct verbiage, Student G.  Good job.  All right, we’re gonna check this one together.  Thank you, Student T, thank you, Student L, for your services.  All right, what is the first step that we do in order to change an improper fraction to a mixed number?  What do we do?  Oh, no, is Student T and Student K and Student E the only ones here today?  Oh, okay.  Student L [Inaudible] You have it on your board, don’t be afraid.",1
"Raise your hand if you got that correct.  Raise your hand if you didn’t and you need me to help you work that out. Who’s still having some trouble?  Okay. All right, erase your boards, because I’m gonna have you work with a partner sitting beside you, and I’m going to be coming around monitoring if there are any questions.  And also I know sometimes you guys learn best from each other too, and you also can find different ways of solving these problems.  You know, my way is probably not always the right way, okay?  And sometimes you guys come up with some creative ways in doing, you know, different problems that I give you, okay?  All right, you have a partner sitting beside you, right?  Everyone has a partner – or across from you.  Just make sure everyone – who doesn’t have a partner? Who doesn’t have a partner?  Okay, you two can work together, you three can work together.  All right, you two, you two, you two and you two.  You two, you two, and across from each other, okay?  Think you got that? Now, you can use one board and work it out together.  Go ahead.  And I’m looking for those groups that are talking it out and I’m looking for the correct verbiage when you’re talking about it.  I want to hear some of that strong math vocabulary.",1
"Good job, Student E.  He’s just discussing over there, they were working out the problems, and he noticed that they didn’t check their work, and he wanted to be sure that they got it correct, okay?  And sometimes we need someone in our group to remind us –",1
"Yes, and practice, and many times if we write it and practice it, we will remember it.  And raise your hand if you’re still having some troubles with either one, mixed numbers or improper fractions.",1
"All right.  Let me press the number in there.  Sixteen-thirds, and submit it.  Good job.  Okay, Student H, if you would, please turn our screen off.  All right, now what I’m going to do is put a few problems on the board so you can transfer them into your folder so you can practice these more tonight, okay?  I know we have – we were reading some of this in our folder, and you can use your folder as a resource as well, because we have some of this information already in there.  But I’m gonna put some problems on the board so you can record them in your folders so you can practice these tonight again.  And I am going to mix them up.  We’re not just gonna have one way, just mixed numerals or just improper fractions, okay?  All right, take out your folders.  Yes, [Inaudible]",1
"Well, you’re gonna have to take out a sheet of paper and transfer it in there.  [Long pause]",0
"You’re good?  Okay.  There’s just enough, ‘cause we practiced this enough today to where you’ll be able to go home and practice.  Hmm?  Now, with each one I want you to show your work and check it.  I’m only giving you two of each because you know you have to check each one, and that gives you added work to that, okay? All right, now take your folders right now, take your math folders right now – not later, right now, and put in your homework binder, ‘cause I know some of us sometimes forget when we’re working on math folders.  You forget that you’re using your math folder instead of your homework folder. And double check to see if you wrote those down correctly. [Long pause] Student E, did you write these down?  You put them in your homework binder?  You put your folder in your homework binder? Okay, all right, thank you, boys and girls.",1
"Excuse me, Student A, Student J was talking.  He has the floor.",1
"Multiplication.  And one of the clues that lets you know that it’s multiplication is of.  So as we take this piece of information, when I ask you two-thirds of four-fifths, okay?  So what they’re really asking you is if you have four-fifths, what is two-thirds of that.  And so in order to find that out, what you would do is just convert the of to a what? A multiplication sign.  So any time you see of, it means for you to multiply, okay?  So this is actually read as two- thirds times four-fifths, okay?  What I want you to do is I want you to take about 30 seconds or so to read the paper that says fraction models.  So read through and look at the steps.  So once you’ve read through this, raise your hand so I’ll know. You’ve got about 10 more seconds.  You don’t have to memorize them.  I just want you to be a little familiar with what’s going on.  Okay, can somebody quickly remind us what it is that we’re doing with this lesson?  What are we doing?  What did I say, so we can be on track.  What are we doing, Student M?",1
"Five is the denominator, okay?  So put that down on your paper somewhere.  Just put that down, just put a note.  Just put that next to it.  We’re gonna use that in one minute, okay? Just put five.  You don’t have to put anything else down. Put the number five. All right, number two.  It says divide the rectangle – this is the rectangle, and you have one on your paper.  This is the rectangle.  So you’re gonna divide the rectangle vertically.  So that’s straight up and down.  Use the number of the denominator to determine the number of divisions.  So there – the denominator is five, right?  So look, pay attention.  Just look up here for the first one. You’re gonna divide this into five parts.  Count – one, two, three, four and five.  They should be equal, but I don’t have a ruler, okay?  So what I want you to do is take yours and divide it into five parts.  Make sure that it’s five parts.  One, two, three, four, five. Okay, so you divide it into five parts.  Okay, so right here, so one, two, three, four, five.  We’ve done that, right?  Shouldn’t take us a long time.  Okay, so now what’s the next one say? Student D, tell us what number three says.",0
"Just follow the directions, okay?Student M, I have the lines going diagonally.I need you to pay attention to that.Okay, make sure you have four of them shaded.Once you have all four of yours shaded, raise your hands.Okay, let me see what you have.Very good.",0
"Please shade that.All right, thank you.Okay.All right, because we need to be together on this.Now, this is where you have to start really paying attention, okay?So now do you think that we’re finished working with – I’m waiting for you to let me ask the question.",1
"Packages.  Okay.  Right.  One of each.  Hold on one second. Let me help these kids finish.  Have you cut out the other one there?  Oh, there it is over there.  Why did it get on his desk?",1
Pass them to [Inaudible].  Just take one little piece and then we’re finished.,0
"I asked nobody to write until I told you to do so. Okay?  And Student PJ, you didn’t hear me say that?",1
"We’re gonna come together.  Okay? Yeah.  You can build those, try to build ‘em.  You know what, Student J?  That is totally uncalled for.  What?  No, we’re doing centimeter [Inaudible].  Student J?",0
You know what?  I don’t know why you went over there but if you’re trying to cause trouble –,0
Many people are finished with the first activity.  Some of you went on to looking at making the prisms.  I want to talk about the first activity as a class. But people need to stop with the blocks.  Need to put their hands like this and face me.  Thank you.  That means you’re not gonna go back in two seconds and start touching the packages again.  All right?  ‘Cause we’re gonna go over some of what was going on here today. Okay.  We built a box.  What were the dimensions of the box?  Raise your hand if you know.  Okay.  Student J?,1
What is it?  Okay.  Raise your hand ‘cause we got too many answers.  Raise your hand if you know.  Student C?,1
"Yeah.  Okay, boys and girls.  Let’s clean up.",0
"Okay.  You may begin cutting.  While you’re cutting I want you to think about as I finish passing out the papers, what are the dimensions of this box going to be?  If anybody knows right now.",0
"3.  Student C, come sit over here.  1 and 3.  So my factors of 3 are 1 and 3.  What are my factors of 9?",0
"She already told me.  Student J, just go ahead.  Leave your things.  You'll come back.  All right.  So I'm going to divide by 3.  What do I divide?  The—",1
"Okay, then make it a line that you would use please.  No, because you're supposed to be working on your work, so you didn't know that he needs an eraser.  You're facing front and doing your answers.  He can ask the person next to him if he needs an eraser.  Okay.  So how can I find one of my fractions for that picture?  Student J?",1
"Sit up, Student B.  Okay.  So Student J, what would be my first fraction I could make out of that?",0
"Can you wait?  Just wait a little bit, okay?  Five, six, and seven.  Show me that first fraction here.  What did you write for a first fraction?",0
"Show me one sixth.  Where is one, and how many of those do I have?  How many of these do I have?  Student D, you're not paying attention, because you're doing what we did two days ago.  You're telling me the fraction that's shaded, and the fraction that's not shaded, and I'm not asking you to do that.  I'm asking you to find equivalent fraction for the shaded part, so look at the shaded part.  What would be one of my fractions for the shaded part?  Erase both answers. What do I have there?  Show me.  Point to them.  Show me.",1
Mm-hmm.  Pay attention.  Okay.  Be careful with number six. Can I group it like I group these?,0
"Three fourths and six eighths.  You need to be writing your answers beforehand.  All right.  Go ahead and look at number right.  Number eight says to use the number lines for two thirds, so on number eight I want you to put two thirds is equal to, then give me two answers.  Use our number lines.  Two thirds is equal to, and I want two fractions that they're equivalent to.  Question, or do you have an answer?  Go.  Next time go on your way back please.",0
"Because they're all in the same.  They're all equivalent.  All right.  Put these in your math folder and take out your math homework.  Thank you, Student D.  Just leave those. Put those in your [inaudible].  Bless you.  Take out your workbook.  Go ahead and wait out in the hall.  Wait for me.",0
"Around the edge of the classroom, right?  There's a difference between area and parameter, okay?  I want you to take the tiles and make me a square using 4 of your tiles.  Push the others to the outside.  Don't raise your hand.  Just make me a square using 4 tiles.  Okay.  Honey, I need you to make me a square using 4 tiles.  Lay them down, honey. Make me a square.  What do we know about a square?",0
"If I told you that the side of – are you listening, Student J? If I told you that the side of a square was five units, five inches – let's say five inches.  If the side of the square was five inches, what would my area be?  He said the side is five inches.  I've got to multiply it by the side, right?  So the area of the square would be 25.  Let's do the same thing for parameter.  Student T, if I told you that the side, one side of a square was five inches, that means we'd know that every side is five inches, right, because the square is the same all the way around.  If one side is five inches, what would my parameter be, Student T?",0
"Because we are putting the numbers in, but this is your formula so any number I give you, you can do it.  Any number I give you, you should be able to find the formula if you know the area is side times side.  Get used to formulas.  You're going to see them all the time now.  You have to use the formula.  Like the formula for division of fractions is the first fraction is the multiplicative inverse of the second fraction.  This is the formula for area and parameter. Please don't play with those anymore.  Let's try again.  If you touch the tiles again, I'm slapping them off the desk, okay?  They're a tool, not a toy, and I shouldn't have to say that to 5th graders.  Okay.  If one side of a square is 12 inches long, Student S, what's the area?  Why are you all – nothing is written up here.  I promise you.  I'm not ever going to write anything up there.  What is the area of a square if one side is 12 inches long?  Baby, look at the formula.  It's on the board.  Student T.",1
"Okay.  Just leave that there.  We'll get you another one.  It's all right.  We'll grab one.  Student J, put [inaudible] in the back.  Okay.  Now listen.  So we know area equals 10. Count the parameter.  What is it, Student J?  Double check, guys.  What's the parameter of 14?  Student T, are you counting inches?  You've got to count the edges.  So the parameter's 14.  All right.  Hold that thought.",1
"Okay.  Student B, listen.  What Student M said was the top and the bottom are the same, and both sides are the same.  What this is called – this is called the long way.  It's called length, and the short way is called width.  Can we come up with a formula for how to get the area?  That's a ticket. Length times width, area of a rectangle.  Look at it. Every single time.  Look at our examples.  Every single time is length times width.  The answer, area is 10, length is 5, width is 2, area is 8, length is 4, width is 2, area is 15, length is 5, width is 3, area is 6, width is 2, length is 3.  Does it work every single time?",0
"So on a square to find the area, how many sides do we need to know to find the area?  If I said you have a square, and one side is five inches long, could you tell me what the area of that square would be?  If I tell you that one side of a square – Student J, you need to look up here.  If one side of a square is five inches long, could you tell me the area using our formula?",0
"Okay.  My next group, you're going to be on the floor back there, is Student M, Student V, Student D, Student S, and Student C.  Okay.  My last group's going to be at table one – I mean table two.  Student C, Student B, Student D, and Student M.  Okay.  Pull out your math workshop folders from yesterday.  I'm going to sit right there.  Okay.  Go ahead and get your paper out.  I think Student D will be back in just a minute.  You're going to work on this first.  Those of you that have not done that can work on that and if you have done that you're going to roll a seven digit number and round to either the ten thousandths or the hundred thousandths.  No, the other dice is over here.  One of you get the milk cartons?",0
Mm-hmm.  It stays an 8.  [Inaudible].  These numbers just come straight down.  Mm-hmm.  How many zeros are in that number? How many more digits are past that 8?  Go on to the next one.  Raise or stay?  I need a band for being off task. Just write it small.  Raise or a stay?,1
"So you each have a graphic organizer for today.  All of you, I have your tests to pass back.  All of you passed with an 84 or higher on your test for yesterday.  You are actually moving on to unit two.  You will work on today – you've finished all number forms, so you're each going to pick one and right it down.  Student D is the first one.  Student D, you're right here.  Actually, you three are with me at table one.  That's for the next task.  Right now get task one and two finish.  It doesn't matter.  Yes.  Just be careful.  You need to double check it.  Okay.  Student C, Student B, and Student E – that's warning number two before worksheet island.  My floor group, they're taking a test. You all need to whisper please.  Math workshop folders. You need your math workshop folder.  Student B has made our number.  Student B, you need to get your place value chart out.  Let's give them a second to catch up since they just got in here.  Now you all are getting the place value. Write data and then what you think its definition might be. You're doing it right now.  Student J, sit down.  Student B, I want you sitting here next to Student D since you're both using the place value chart.",1
"So make sure you put a comma between the one thousandths and the hundreds.  Very good.  Who thinks they can put a 1 in the ten thousandths place?  I want you to do that in the value chart.  Student E, why don't you read that number for me.  I need a whisper.  Very good.  Count five digits from here.  Okay.  Get started.  Put it in word form first. You're finished?  There's no highlighting here.  I need to see the highlight.  You double checked it?  Because this is your big test for the unit.  Put it on my table up front, and then you can pull a file folder down.  Student A, a file folder out of the blue basket behind you.  Yes.  Pull one of those down.  Read today's task.  What does it say? What's that number?  Okay.  Let's look at this number. This is what number?  What's the last name?  We write 12,000.  Say the number, then the last name.  Hold your paper up for me.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  That goes above that dash.  Very good.  Put it in expanded form on your graph paper.  Okay.  You can get a file folder again.",1
"Where's your highlighter?  Do you want to do another one or take the quiz?  Table one, you're doing a great job, but you all need to quiet it down.  They're all still taking a test right behind you, and I have two gentlemen taking the test over here.  Sit in the middle and get a clipboard. Student D, you do have graph paper, right?  You can use anything in your math workbook folder to help you, okay? You need to highlight.  Student D, come see me really quick.  Highlight that number.  Now what do we do?  Circle which number?",1
"What makes the raise number?  Raises is going to be 5, 6, 7, so 5 or higher.  Wait a minute.  We're still on number one. What happened to number 5?  Okay.  What about all the numbers to the left right here?  Student C, they're taking a test.  Write the numbers to the left.  Okay.  Numbers to the left, numbers to the right, zeros.  I've got number two.  You're going to highlight the underlined digit.  Very good.  The only thing I want to see here – I want you to highlight the operations, so the addition and the subtraction sign.  Remember what I told you?  Sometimes people make silly mistakes.  Someone was double checking a minute ago and they subtracted instead of adding.  Just make sure you're highlighting that because that will be that visual reminder.  I've highlighted this.  Table two, I see a lot of staring.  Give me just one second to work with Student V, and I'll be right over there.  Read the next task.  What's my number to the right of it?  So what happens to my 7?  My numbers to the left?",1
"All right, boys and girls, eyes on me, please.  All right, today we're going to be talking about line graphs.  Who can remember what kind of information we would use a line graph for?  Student T?",0
"Student D?  Student T, sorry one second, can you put that book box on the floor?  It's kind of I can't see you.  To show stocks, the money that’s in the stock market and if your own stocks are rowing or, right now, a lot of them aren’t unfortunately.",1
Line graph.  Just wait 'cause we're going to go over it in a second.,1
"What's going on, Student A?  All right, you need to get a regular chair.  Push your chair back.  Get a regular chair. Yes?",0
"We're not going to do that right now.We're going to move into another lesson.All right, I need you to close everything and set it to the side.Like it doesn’t matter.Just set it to the side.Okay, sh.I'm going to read to you a little poem, and then we're going to do a little activity.",0
"Okay, so raise your hand if you can tell and share with me some ideas of how your world would be different if you were one inch tall.  Student J?",0
You’ve had a turn so put your hand down.  Student M?  Student N?,1
"Okay, you might be squished.  What else, Student J?  I hear some side conversations going on, and that's not using our manners.",1
"Okay, good.  Patient your hands down.  Tomorrow what we're going to do is we're doing to move on into–why do you have a book to during math class?  That's only if we finish work early and you need to read.",1
"Out of your workbook.  Okay, if you got to another teacher, quietly line up.  My class put your math things away.",0
"Put the book boxes that are near you on the floor so I can see what you're doing 'cause I can tell you're not making a good choice right now.  Student A, I'm talking to you.",1
You're supposed to come to class with paper.,1
"You need to be doing this for math class, okay?",1
"Two sets of data.  The s is not with the t.  Student N? Student I, what?  I can't hear you.  What do you think?  It could be if you had that amount of data.  It's up to you what you get.  Let's focus.  The one you need to study on is just a bar graph and a double.  Now what's going to be happening with – Student M, stop with the noises.  Okay. What you are doing at your seat if you are in – actually, I'm going to make this D as well.  You're going to meet with small group today.  If you are in C, B, or D, you are doing page 98 in your text book.  It's the chapter review, so it's going to help you.  You do the whole thing.  You're finished with that before I am done with my group, you can work on your accelerated math packets or you can take it to your seat math envelopes.  Where are my take it to your seat envelopes?  Just get out any of the math.  This is independent work time while I'm meeting with my group.  So if B, C, and D are doing independent work, what group should be over here?",0
We're going to be at the table.  We're not going to be on the floor because I didn't know if it would catch me on the floor.  Student M?,1
Independent at your seat.  I would have written it on the board if I was going to let you do math games.  Why are you guys up?  Go sit down.,0
"Yes.You can pick whichever one you want.Have a seat please.A should be in the back table, and everyone else should get seated.I was not saying get up.Go sit down.You can pick any of these.Just pick one that you're doing, whichever you want to do.Okay.",1
"You've got to double check your answers.Student M, do you need to leave my room?Then sit down and work.Student I, what are you working on?You're supposed to be doing textbook page 98 on a piece of paper.Textbook, not workbook.It's review for chapter four text Monday.",0
"40 plus 6, so now you're doing 432 – write this down – times 40, and 432 times 6.  Okay.  So you have two smaller problems now.  You have this one and this one.  Student T, Student C, Student N, everyone needs to be working please. I hear talking, so it doesn't sound like it.  All right. So do 432 times 6 first.  We can all do this.  Student S, you finished all of page 98, and drawing the two graphs on the bottom?  Page 98, I believe it said you have to make two graphs.  432 times 6.  Come on, Student J.  You're missing a digit.  What's 6 times 2, Student L?",0
"Does week four?  Okay.  I just wanted to get through that big one right here since you were able to get through that. You guys go back to your seats and work on textbook page 98, and then I need Student M, Student J, Student T, come here with paper and pencil please, Student J, and Student H.  Pencil and paper.  You keep that one.  Excuse me. Don't touch – guys, sit back down, please.",0
"I think you made it 25 because this should be 32.4.  You have to put – read the instructions on the front.  There is a thing that you're going to put through here.  It's like a slide.  You'll see it.  Questions about that?  Let's see. Stop tapping.  Okay.  You guys don't need to go over that. You know the basics.  This should have been 32.4.  I don't know where you got 35.  Maybe you did 6 times 5 is 32.  I'm not sure.  Okay.  Looks like I need to go over the 432 times 46.  Okay.  It should be breaking it up into two solid numbers, because it looks like it's a really big number.  What would 46 be broken up into expanded form, Student T?",0
"94.  Anybody else?  When I call your name, please bring it to me so I can see it.  Let me see the score and then put it in your cubby to go home please.  Student M?  Student B? Please watch the camera, do not bump the camera please? Okay, okay.  Student B, Student W?  Okay, okay.  Student P, Student K.   Okay.  Student T, Student L.  Student M, Student H.  Student K, Student J.  Student D, Student G. Student J, Student K.  Student J and Student J.  Your hand’s over your score, honey.",0
"All right, let’s go ahead and get started with today’s assignment.  Open up your math books to page 178, problem solving.  Student K, sit on your bottom please.  Student J, I suggest you move somewhere where you can look at somebody’s book.  All right, problem solving.  Who’s that in the group still running their mouth Student J?",1
"You have to multiply.  It is a multiplication problem.  So the first step, we have to choose the operation.  The operation is multiply.  What am I multiplying?  Raise your hand please, and nice and loud.  Student P?",0
"Raise your hand.  I got a whole bunch of different answers. Student M, where do you think I’m going to put this 1?",0
Under the 2.  Raise your hand if you agree with Student M if you think I should put it underneath the 2.  Student M is the only one correct in my classroom then.  1.  It is a whole number.  It is a 1.  When you add and subtract decimals you must line them up.  This is a time where I’m telling you about lining up numbers.  We have not done adding and subtracting decimals.  You must line them up. 3 minus 0 is?,0
Huh?  Some of you guys say your answer and then you’re not confident enough to repeat it.  Make sure you say it loud and clear.  How much did they totally weigh?,1
"2 pounds.  Student M, put the scissors away, I have no idea what you need scissors for right now.  2 pounds.  So how much is 2 pounds on Mercury?  What kind of problem is this?",1
"2 times.  So if you had given me either one of those answer choices it would have been correct.  For some reason they’re not practicing the problems like the ones that are on our homework.  So what I want to do is, I want to give you your homework assignment right now.  We’re going to practice a problem or two on there, okay?  Can I get my two helpers please?  As soon as you get your homework assignment, please put your name and number at the top. Voices are off.  Who doesn’t have one?  You need to go put one on Student D’s desk.  Anyone else not have one? Student B doesn’t need one. Okay, looking at the problem, let’s do number one together.  It says, “Debbie’s father needs to buy two new tires for his car. He reads in the newspaper that the tire store is selling tires 4 for $157.80.  If each tire costs the same amount, how much will Debbie’s father pay for 2 tires?” This is a two-step problem.  Almost every single one of your word problems on your math test tomorrow are going to have two steps.  What is the first step?  What do you have to do first?  We need to figure out how much what?",0
You should be doing this with me please.,0
"When I’m dividing this?  Guys, guys, excuse me.  Can you stop for a second and listen.  It’s just like we did the first problem, and that’s what I keep on telling you.  You’re going to have multiple steps.  If this is how much the whole box costs – and I’m starting with this – and I divide it by 15 equal groups, what is that answer telling me? What?",0
"18.  Student K, put it away. Subtract and you get?",0
Office Depot.  I'm sorry.  I can't heart Student Z.  Some people are being rude.,1
"Yeah, it will still come off.  Please don't use this too much, but there's a sharpener on the back if you need it.  If you are in group B, go ahead and go to the multiplication station.  Please don't make a mess.  All right.  Group A, meet me at the back.  [Inaudible].  Does everyone have a marker and eraser?  I'd like them all moved over.  Look in the other folder and see if it ended up in the wrong folder.  Get a data set, and then I want you to find the mean and median.  [Inaudible].  The first thing you need to do is what?  Put them in order.  I have them.  Then you can go back in order.  Put them in order first, and then you can do that.  Definitions are on the board to help you. You have them in order?  Then do the range, mean, and median.  The definitions are on the board if you need them. The first thing you're going to do is what, Student A? Okay.  Find the range.  Let's go.  When you do subtraction, what goes on the top?  The bigger number, or the smaller number?",0
"No.  Do not erase it.  I'm going to look over it and see what you've done today.  It has to be a whiteboard or something [inaudible].  You should not be talking.  You're good. That's fine.  I should see multiplication station cleaning up, please.  One more day of it tomorrow and then we'll be ready for our testing.  Let's go ahead and rotate to your last station.  Wait for Student A, please.  I need multiplication station to have a seat.  Thank you.  Those of you who are already done [inaudible].  I'm hearing a conversation at multiplication station that I should not be hearing.  If you're at multiplication station, start cleaning up.  10 minutes.  [Inaudible].",0
"We don’t need to call out.  Good.  Yep, that one.  I’m going to give you a data set with some bigger numbers and I want you to find me the range, the median and the mode.  And remember, once I give you your data set, what’s the first thing you’re gonna do?",0
"Then you should have been paying attention.  All right.  So, let’s add across and then down.  So, 1600 plus 400 is?",0
"Student D, are you with me?  ’Cause I don’t see you writing.",1
"I see some friends doing it.  Playing with your ruler is certainly not what you should be doing.  All right, now, three times six is?",1
"Okay, if you’ve only done it once, how many of you – raise your hand – how many of you have only done it one time?  Holy molly, you guys are avoiding journal.  This is not good. Okay, I can’t have that many people.",1
"If you’re finishing it, you can go too.  That’s fine.  You might just have to share.  So, if you’ve never done math calendar, come.",0
"It should have been turned into Teacher T.  Your name needs to go on it.  And, well, you know what?  That was from last week.  Never mind.  You’re just gonna have to hold on to it.  Okay.  Right now is not the time to come up to me. All right, so, red and orange come choose a center.  If you need to be with me, just put yourself under with me and we’ll get going in a minute.",1
"Okay.  Yellow and blue come put yourself – if you’re with me, then you guys need to gather chairs, get back there at the table.  If you kind of – Student K, will you take all of those timelines and bring ’em on over to Teacher V?",0
"Please push in your chairs when you go away from your desk, so that I don’t have to do that for you.  Guys, don’t worry about color.  Just pick one out and –",1
"– we’re not digging for a specific color.  Just pick one and let’s get to work.  Drag more chairs if we need ’em. Student J, do you have a whiteboard?",0
So you might need to steal another chair from somewhere.  Just use one that someone else is not using.,0
"If he brought it over here, then you need to grab another one. There’s still a stack of chairs over there.  We’re just gonna have to make lots of room and crowd around.  There’s lots of us.",1
"Well, then, come on, join us.",0
"Scooch down, scoot, scooch.  I promise.  You too scooch that way.",0
Student C is not gonna bite you.  Scooch over.,0
"You can just leave it open on the floor, Student M.  Just leave it on the floor, ’cause we’ll have to put our stuff away afterwards anyway, so that’s all right.",1
"Student J, will you scooch.  You’re a little bitty thing.  You should be able to let her by.",1
"It’s cool.  Just make sure your tissue gets in the trash.  If you feel like you need more, you’re free to stay.  If you feel like you got it, you’re free to go.",1
"Two times zero is – there we go.  Now, we got it.  And once you add it, you should get it just fine. All right.  So, put your whiteboards away and your whiteboard markers away, please.",0
"Oh, Student E, will you put mine away too.  Thank you, my dear.",0
"All right, I need you to clean up, please.  I need you to clean up and get to your seats, please.",0
"No.  Student J, sit down, please.  Okay, and was it page 439?",0
"No, they don’t just make a circle, because these are for a car or a track or bike.  They’re all what?  They’re all different sizes.  You have 22 inch alloy wheels, they have 20 inch alloy wheels, they have 18 inch alloy wheels.  You make – huge trucks, those are those silvery kind, the silver stuff in the middle.  That’s called alloy.  Student A, will you please stop playing with her hair?  Thank you.",0
"I know.  Now, look at this one.  It says how to solve for circumference given the formula and the measurement. Turning into an owl in here?  No?  Okay.  When given the diameter, you multiply 3.14 by the diameter to solve, so in this case, multiply 3.14 by seven.  So go ahead and open the last page of your folder, the last empty page in your folder and tell me – why is everything out, honey?",0
"Very good.  In the second one, what have we been given?  Guys, look up here before you begin working.  Student A.",0
"Well, start quickly, honey.  Don’t be drawing.  Okay, [Inaudible].  It is so much work.  Look at this.  You’re going to be out of fifth grade and you will have all this space empty, right?  Can you make it bigger and clearer? Yes?",0
"Yeah, You are number one, you’ve got it, good going, super work.  You can take it and put it on your clothes.",0
Shh.,0
Okay.  How about this?  Put your pencil down if you’re done. Put your pencil on your paper when you’re done so I know you’re done.,1
"But why you complicate your life?  Just do – follow the formula, okay, ‘cause sometimes you might end up making a mistake there.  Okay, I need your pencils down if you’re done.  If your pencils are still in your hand, you’re still working, so I don’t have to ask around.  One, two, three, four, five.  Five people still working.  Six.  Do you really need to do two times two?  Shouldn’t you be able to do it in your head?",1
Okay.  Raise your hand if you get a sticker.,0
"Okay.What you're supposed to do, if you look at the array, what is it, 12 times 16 we were doing?We're breaking up the 12.So you said a 6, a 5, and a 1.That's fine.Okay.I asked you once to sit up.We're not laying down.We're not at home.Sit on your bottom.",0
"Everybody in this group go to the computers. Student N, I don't know where you're going.You're still with me. I'm just going to wait for Student M to be done and then you can do it together. Sit and do your work. Feet down. Do you need to use the restroom?",1
"No, it's not 34.  Yeah, 30 and 12.  You're right.  I don't understand why you're getting out of your seat right now. I'm a little confused.  Can you explain that to me?  Why are you out of your seat?  Student J, why are you out of your seat?  You guys are at the back table.  The digit cards.",0
"I don't know.  Figure it out.  Let's see it.  Okay.  That's just a strategy to set it up.  Very nice.  You guys got it? You guys have an answer?  Okay.  Now I don't care if your answer is right or wrong right now.  By the time you leave me, you'll know how to do it.  You need to settle down. Student G, you doing your work?",0
"This group right here, you four right here, you're going to start with the fast math, and you two will go after them.Okay.All right.So this group right here, you're going to be starting your subtraction problems.This group right here, I'm going to need you to come up to the rug.",0
"If you went to number one – that's what you need to do.You need to practice applying what we learned in class.Okay.Stop yelling out.So for number one, if I was using the thinking blocks, we had to find the whole, and you had to multiply the 14 and the 12.",0
"Turn your paper over.I mean, open up your notebooks.You guys need to settle down a little bit.I'm a little disappointed that you're being so goofy.Settle down.Let's do 16 times 12.Let's do 14 times 18.Student M, you should be working right now.Okay.",1
"We're going to figure it out.  Why don't you sit on your bottoms?  One more time, warnings.  Let's think about it. You said – you know what, the last problem we did, you said, ""I feel pretty good about breaking it up according to place value.""  Let's take a look at this.  16 times 12, 12 times 16, whatever, okay?  You can put it left or on the top.  It's not important.  So 12 times 16.  Let's break up the 12.  Okay.  Student M, why don't you pay attention? You're going back to doing your repeated addition again. Let's look at what we're doing.  Let's focus on breaking it up.  Okay.  Student E, how can I break up the 12?  What can I do?",1
Go back to your seat and do your work.  I will tell you when to go up.  What's 2 times 16?,1
"Good.  So you've done all the steps.  The only thing you have left to do is find the area.  Area equals pi times R squared.  This little symbol right here is pi.  For now just know that pi is 3.14.  So you need to multiply this number by 3 and fourteen hundredths.  You can put it on your board.  You need to make sure you have at least one object done, and I want you to try to get one more done. We have five more minutes before we conclude, so be working hard, and make sure you're working and not chatting.  You have your diameter, and you found your radius which is great.  Now radius squared is what?  When we say squared, that means we multiply the same number two times.  So your radius is – then you have to multiply that by the same number.  You might want some more space.  I'll see how you're doing.  We'll talk about it later.  How we doing? Yeah.  Good.  Looks good.  All done?  Nice.  Excellent job. Any questions?  The only thing I'm seeing is you're missing a unit for the coin.",1
"Exactly.  Okay.  I need you talking math, nothing else.  How we doing?  You're doing well so far.  I like that.  Keep going.  You squared that.  Okay.  I need you to put your markers down, put your objects down, then look right back up here.  Look over here with me.  You did very well at this, and we're going to continue on with this the next time.  Right now I just want you to turn your paper over, and at the top of it write the formula for area of a circle.  What is the formula for your area of a circle, Student M?",0
"Multiply what?  Radius times the – just like you did here.  You multiplied 2 times 2 to get 4, right?  So you have to multiply your radius times your radius.  All right, guys. Team captains, I need you to carefully and quietly pick up your objects.  Put them back in the bag.  I need you also to get your papers and put them in the math tray over there.  If you did not finish, that's okay.  We'll get back to it next time.  All right.  Good.  Who's team captain here?  Math tray.  Team captains, you got all the objects? Thank you.  Paper in the math tray.  I'm looking for a team with their desk cleared off to get points.",1
"Excellent.  Okay, guys.  Today we're going to work more with area.  We're going to work with objects, the same objects we worked with circumference, but this time we're going to be working with the area.  I'm going to give you this piece of paper, and what you're going to do is when I give this piece of paper to you, you may go back to your desk.  I'm going to have a chart on the screen, and I want you to put in the headings for each section of the chart, all right? Student D, can you keep passing it out so I can put the chart on the screen?  Thank you.  You're going to do it landscape, just like you'll see up on the screen.  Thank you Student S and Student C for following directions and coming back quickly, doing what you need to do.  Be careful where you are walking please.  You are copying your headings at the top of your paper.  It is landscape.  I want you to go over with Ms. G today.  Bring this with you. You need this.  You still need your boards today guys, so you need your boards, a pencil, and a paper.  Object, diameter, radius, radius squared, area, at the very top. Go like this.  Put it like that.  Good.  That's good.  Like that.  It goes this way.  For your third column you should have those two little columns.  Excellent.",0
"Now you can choose any three shapes you want. if your plate might have a crack in it, that might not be the best one to use.Use any three shapes that you want.You can work together with your team to get this completed.You have to have three objects, and calculate the area of three different objects.",0
I'm sorry.  Can you speak up?,0
"Multiples of what number?  So what is this a list of? Multiples of 19, maybe not the best choice of numbers.  So what would I have known if I had started – eyes and ears on me – whatever multiples of 19?  I would have known that I would have run out and not been able to put one more piece of candy in the last box.  Did you see what I just did?",0
"So let's go guys, on your paper, right in front of you, on your notebook, list your multiples of 25.  What's the second multiple of 25, Student J?  Pretend it's quarters I'm going to count.  The first one is 25, after that it's 50.  After 50 comes what?  So it's 50, 75, 100, keep going.  Tell me when you get to a number as close to 240 as you can get, everyone.  You too.  Everyone.  Use your multiples.  25, 50, come on.  Let's go.  What did you do?  You got it? Good.  What have you got?  Who's got it?  Student E and Student J, front of the room, I'm really, seriously going to release you in a minute.  You tell me.  Changing the words to make it nicer isn't going to change the fact that I'm still hearing you.  25, 75, 100.  Then what?  What comes next, Student J?",0
"Then what comes?  150, 175, 200, 225, 250 is too big.  So look. Look what I just did.  How many groups of 25 did I list? Count the number of multiples.  Student C, you have a strike.  Stop talking.  I'm not competing with you anymore. How many groups of 25?  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 groups of 25.  What's going to be leftover?  How much more to get you to 240?  Student S?",1
"Look at the board for a minute.What I want you to do is create a story problem and I want that story problem to go with one specific multiplication problem.Here it is right here.170 divided by 15.When I told you to – put your foot on the floor, please.",0
"So I am going to tell you that you are going to use this problem.What's the problem that you are going to use?Student F, I am up here and you are drawing, from what I can tell, and that's not cool in my world.I'm teaching a math lesson.Student T?",1
"If you do another problem besides 170 divided by 15, I'm not even going to correct it.Time to pay attention to the directions.The last five minutes of an instruction are usually the most critical time.Next on the list, you have to have a clearly displayed solution, and you need to make sure that you take care of your reader.",1
"Please don't write like you don't care.I don't want to solve hieroglyphics.I want to read print that I can read, that you take care, Student R, to write carefully.Make it organized.Come up with a plan.Lastly, your visual representation of your solution is something like that.",1
"I'm going to stand here so no on trips over anything.Group one, over here.Group two, over here.Watch out.That's what time it is.Group one, group two, group three goes here, group four.Your time is fine.Group four right there.I know you're not in a group yet, but I'm going to put you in a group.",1
"I'm on my way.I'm sorry, what?What you need to do right now is you and your partner need to get together.Are you guys ready to listen?You two are partners?You and Student G are partners.Come up with a plan.Write your word problem.You three, one, two, three.",1
"Come up with the problem for 170 divided by 15.You both have to agree on it.Understood?You are working with him.You need one paper for two people.Stop it.You need to work with her.Her name, your name, one problem.You want to trade for collateral?",1
"Bad manners.If you're bleeding to death, that's a different story, but you weren't.Okay, you guys over here.170 divided by 15 belongs on your paper.I like that you listened.Let's go right here.Your name, 170 divided by 15.What can you think of that's a word problem that you can solve?",0
"So 15 cages at the zoo.  Okay.  How are we doing over here? You better have some work on paper.  You said you don't want to work alone?  If you're not going to work alone, you have a partner.  I gave you a partner.  I gave you a choice.  You chose one, and now you're changing your mind. I'm going to have to think about that.  Stop talking.  Eyes and ears on me.  I do have homework for you. I'm going to have to give it to you through Ms. C.  Student N, I love that you're listening to my voice right now.  What you have in front of you, the papers you have in front of you—",1
"So if you know that you have to divide something by another number, you can also use multiplication to find your answer.  I would love it if you would get with us, because chorus is over.  We are all taking notes, and you have to join us, please.  So what's first before I go any further? Let's stop and think about a problem you can give me, a story problem that you can give me that will help you stay on track, and know what it is you're looking for, and what that answer would be and what it would mean when it's all done.  Who can come up with a story problem that goes with 170 divided by 15?  It doesn't have to be Jack and Jill did this, and then they went there, then they did this, and then they decided they wanted 15 of these.  It doesn't have to be five miles long.  It needs to be short and sweet. Let's make it quick and easy.  Student E, go.",1
"Yeah.  Take it with you.  Settle down, please.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1. In your notebook, skip a line from your last notes.  Write division problems.  Write today's date.  Today's date is November 7th.  You don't have the school supplies you need yet.  I'll help you with that.  What you see in front of you is this camera.  This camera films all three ways around the room, and it can only film kids who have permission to have their pictures taken, and is it you, Student N, or is it Student N who can't be here?  Your job, my darling girl, is going to be to relocate over there to – actually, you can sit behind Student J.  Remember when the ladies came in and they gave you the test on math?",1
"That's your personal opinion.  I don't want to shut off the lights because I'm afraid it will mess up the filming.  So you're writing it all down.  Everything on the board is on the paper.  Let's go.  Let's say that I go for another problem and I switch the numbers, or switch the way that the paper is put together.  Does everybody have this written down?",1
"Now this is me teaching to you, and we're going to see how well you do, and they're studying how teachers teach math, and how well kids do.  I'm going to start my lesson now, and conversations about other things aren't going to happen. You need something for a pencil?  Give me collateral and let's hurry up guys.  This is ridiculous how long it takes you to settle in.",0
"If I have 15 times 10 equals 150, how much further do I have to go to get to 170?  I'm sorry.  Student C, when we raise our hands, then I can hear you.  What do I have to do, Student D?",1
"Obviously, the camera is about to start, so you’re gonna have to sit down and act your best behavior.  Student F, you need to go to another room, as in Teacher’s.",1
"This is a microphone, picking up every sound that you say to me right now.  So focus on this.",1
"Maybe you should stick to the other menu.  That might be out of your budget right now.  Okay, Student H and Student C, you need to depart.",0
"All right, clap once if you can hear me.  Okay.  How many of you – a show of hands – are having trouble meeting the budget of $50.00 right now?  I know Student J’s group, they have $10.99 for dessert for one person.  That’s not gonna help them out.",0
"Are you good?  Okay.  You need to get out your math journals, open them up to a new page.  Today’s date is February 7th, 2011, Monday.  Even you, Student E.",0
"Student A, you’re gonna want to sit down now.",0
"Okay, clap once if you can hear me.  I’m gonna try to make this the last time as a whole class last announcement.  If you’re having trouble with that $75.00 budget, there is a $100.00 budget.  However, I am going to give a ticket voucher to the group that is able to order for eight people and spend the least amount of money.  So I’m gonna say you have up to $100.00 to spend.  So forget about that.  You have up to $100.00 to spend.  However, the group that has what they’ve ordered written down for each one of these things, what each one of these cost and then the total amount, and if that total amount is the least of each group, that group is – that group, those two people or three people in some cases now, they’re gonna get a ticket voucher.  Student A?",0
"There you go.  Good.  All right, try to keep your voices down, get to work and we’ll come back as a whole group in 15 minutes.  Have your final product ready.  Yes, ma’am?",0
"All right, you two go to the restroom, get your water, come back, do your work.  Take it with you.  No one’s gonna come over here.",0
"For the purposes of this activity, because we’re filming, I would like you to stay in the desks [Inaudible].  If you have – if there’s spots on the floor somewhere, that’s fine, if you want to get comfortable, as long as it’s on this side of the room.",1
Go back to your group.,0
"Student J, raise your hand.  I’ll be able to see it.",1
"All right, Student B, before you yell out they don’t have drinks, take a second, look through the menu.",1
"All right, well, we might send you to the clinic, then. Student J?",0
"All right, Student B and Student E, you can have a seat.  You can read a book until we get everybody’s.  You have about three minutes left.  I have Student T’s, I have Student A’s.  No, no, no, we’re not gonna discuss that yet.  Keep that to yourself.  Student A and Student T, turn around.",0
"Hurry, hurry, hurry.  All right, you’re going to turn your sheet in to me in one minute.  If you have not already, I need them in one minute with whatever you have on it.",1
"All right.  Can you straighten the books, please?  I’m going to announce the winner in a little bit.  All right, at this time, if you have any chance of getting or earning the tickets, you need to be turning in your sheet right now. You have a chance, believe in yourself.",1
"Student N, can you stop doing that, please?",0
"And if you are a boy, bring your menu and put it in the basket.",0
You do?  Looks like Student J is working alone.  See if you can join with her.  Yep.,0
"Minus one fourth?  Minus one-fifth, okay.  Okay, good.  All right, go ahead and grab your binders.",0
"As you have probably guessed, we’re recording this lesson for the Harvard study I’m taking part in for math teaching.  It doesn’t mean you act any differently.  I know a lot of you freaked out and want to act silly.  I hope you’ve gotten that out of your system, so you can really just stay focused.  There’s a lot I want to get done with you today. We’re going to be working on transforming for the math activity, on the laptop that we started yesterday.  Does anybody remember the three kinds of transformations we talked about?  Student M.",1
You all go back to your seats and I’m gonna tell you what we’re gonna do at the other stations.,0
"No.  Would you sit down please?  Then once you’ve written out your name, there are protractors right here, and then I want you to try and go and measure as many different kinds of angles that you see in your name as possible.  I want you to tell me are they acute, right or obtuse and give me a number.  Tell me it’s 80 degrees or 20 degrees.",0
"I want to thank the people who are waiting with their hands up. Student A, did you have a question?",0
So let’s try this again.  The time timer goes off.  What do I do?,0
"If the time timer goes off after you were here, where do you go?",0
I’m gonna be looking for good thinking.  I’m gonna be looking for you working together and being nice to each other.,0
"What I need you guys is to do is [inaudible].  Work on raising your hand or [inaudible].  You also have two sets of smaller triangles that are also isosceles.  Now you do have a medium sized triangle, but that’s last because there’s one of those.",0
"I see that’s a lot in quilting, that they’ll take one pattern and turn it to make more patterns.  A lot of art, they’ll start with one shape and do things to it to make things that look nice to people.  Thank you for raising your hand.",0
"Okay.  I asked you guys to put away your snacks.  Thank you so much if you followed those directions.  Can you please put away your snacks [inaudible]?  And let’s say hello to page 289 in the student reference book.  You probably know by now at the back of the student reference book there are directions for how to play a lot of the math games that we play.  I’ll read with you and then I’ll actually show you how the game works.  What I’d like to do is break up into groups a little bit sooner than we usually do, and then you’ll have more time in each station.",0
"Yeah, we already cut them out, so you need your set of Polygon Capture pieces, which are the polygons and the cards. Those are in the envelope, and you’re gonna need somebody to play me so [inaudible] the same from yesterday.  What is the object of the game?  You win by collecting as many polygons as possible.  Who can read the directions?  I hope you’re following along, Student D, please.",0
"Okay.  Number three: when all the property cards have been drawn, shuffle the cards and sort them again into two face down piles [inaudible].  The game ends when there are fewer than three polygons left and the winner is the player with the most polygons.  You might not have gotten all that, so what I would like to do is show you how this game works. So we’re gonna gather around like a fishbowl, around this green table.  Be nice for the people who are watching at home on the camera ‘cause they’ll see us, so maybe we can just leave a space for that.  If you’re in front, can you please kneel?",1
You need to rethink what you’re doing.  So here’s the idea. You’re playing with another person.  Take a deep breath and let it all out and see if you can focus.  The same thing with Student O.  We’re gonna decide who goes first.  How do you want to do that?,0
"9.3.  Boys and girls, if you've gotten decimals for answers, which is what you guys are getting, for your measurements, and you've multiplied them out, nod your head if you agree that you should know how to multiply decimals by now.  I don't see much nodding going on.  Everybody knows how to do it, right?  Okay.  Here's what you can do.  If you've already done your math, and you've figured out areas of sections of your house, and you want to use the calculator to check your math, you can use a calculator to check, not to figure, but to check, okay?  I'm coming to you, Student M.  To check.",0
"Okay.  I would say all those 132 somethings, 131 somethings, I would say that those would all be okay.  139?  Okay.  Let me just ask this one thing.  Listen up.  You two, come back please.  What would keep us from getting such a variety of answers, besides everybody measuring the exact same way?",0
"Possibly, because just like centimeters make it easier for you to get a more accurate answer, guess what?  If we rounded them all to the whole number, then we would all have the same number, or would be more likely.  Listen.  Please do not yell out your answer.  All I want you to do is think about, is what you came up with – Student T, listen – is what you came up with reasonable?  Much more importantly, is what you did reasonable?",0
"If you drew this on to the grid paper, that would be a good strategy probably.  Listen please, because we're running out of time.  Here's what I would like for you to do.  For homework I would like you to – yes, I would like for you to try to find the area of this figure on the back of your paper.  Now I'm telling you, this one's a little bit trickier, but I don't think it's – please stop talking while the teacher's talking – but I don’t think it's going to be anything that you can't figure out.",1
"So go ahead and put this in your folder.  If you need a ruler, take it, but please guys, the ruler supply is getting smaller and smaller, so make sure you bring it back.",1
"So I just want to start.  Go ahead and put your name.  I'm going to say that one more time.  I want you to figure out the area of this.  This is called the compound figure, by the way.  I want you to find the area of this sheet, but I also want you to be prepared to tell us how you did it, okay?  While I'm passing out your papers you can get your stuff out of the way.  Student S, give yourself some space to work.  Oops, I didn't give you enough.  Hold on.  If you didn't already put your name at the top, go ahead and do that so we can see who did what.  All right.  Go ahead.",1
"Some cubes you can't see, but they're not really there.  You have to really be careful.  If this was an activity that I wanted you to come up to the Promethean Board to kind of investigate that for me, this might be something that you might want to do to check what's going on back there, which is really nothing. I'm going to put this figure back together, and I would like for you to tell me the volume, and if you would like to build it with the cubes that you have at your group, you can do that.  Give me a thumbs up when you have the volume of this figure.  You need to put the notebook away.  I want you to concentrate on your math. Student B, can you take a handful and go sit at your desk so you don't have to keep getting up?  Thank you.  Student D is strategically putting together his irregular figure, and everyone's cooperating over here.  Good.  How are we doing?  Oh, Student S, looking good.  Giving me a thumbs up.  That's a tricky one.  Student M's got the volume. Looks like some other people are checking in with volume. Nice job, Student H.  I like your figure that you have going on there.  Student M, since I saw your hand first, I'll call on you first.  What did you get for the volume of this irregular figure?",1
"Thank you very much.  Today you will work with a partner on a practice page where you will need to find the length, height, width, and volume, and you are given boxed patterns.  You will also find dimensions for double and half each pattern's original volume.  Patterns are on this paper.  Early finishers may provide patterns for their double and half dimensions.  That's only for early finishers.  Let me get rid of this monster box of cubes. Thank you Student A for filling that up to the very top. We'll stand up and pick partners.  Student K, can you turn on the lights, please?  Okay.  Student K, you can start since you did such a great job today.  Student S?",1
"So it's either 3 cubes long, 2 cubes high, and then the volume is cubic units, because that's the amount of space it takes up when it's all done. Do you need a new pencil?It's looking pretty small.Student J, you're not doing what I asked you to do, okay?",0
"2.You have to remember that for each of these and be specific.Student J, you have to go back to your desk.There's too much work to be done and you don't have time to waste.Can you make your way back to your desk?Student A, can you make your way back to your desk as well?",1
You guys going to be okay working across from each other?You need to continue with your work.I separated your group because you started to talk about things unrelated to math.That's your decision.You can do that for homework.That second one looks much better.,1
"36.  So for this one here, you want to try to find dimensions. That would be 36.  What about the half one?  What's half of 18?  Only 9.  Does that answer your question, Student M? Okay.  Student D, you're staying on task, right?",0
"Okay.  So we’re going to end up using two strategies.  Nobody should be writing now; we should be done.  All right, so let’s see who hasn’t been up to the board in a long time?",0
"Sit up, please.  Are you okay?  Please sit up.  What’s going on?  When you break two two-digit numbers apart what are you finding that you must do?",0
The bottom answer.  Could you come and show me?  I wish you’d sit on a chair Student A.,0
Can you stop for a minute?  What’s wrong with that work? What’s going on?  Could you stop working for a second? Could you move back so we can see?  What’s going on guys? Where – anybody in the middle have any idea what’s happening?  Student N.,0
Does that make sense?  So here’s your number.  What is 27 times 14?  And you’re going to work with your partner.  So you need your book and then we’re going to come back together and solve it.  So you want to work with your partner. You have exactly ten minutes to solve it and talk about it with your partner.,0
"Move over Student K.  I want to hear you talking to your partner about what you’re doing; I don’t want it to be an individual job, okay?  So if your partner breaks the numbers apart for now, you want to stick with the same strategy.",1
"Student A, you can’t work ahead of your partner, honey.  You have to [bring] your partner; you have to talk about how you’re going to break those numbers down.  And when you break numbers down you want to think about what is comfortable for me to multiply?  So what would be a good way to break this number down?",1
"The way that I think about this game is have you ever gone to a fair and you play the water things that you squirt, and you’re squirting like a button and then the horses, you’re trying to get to the finish line with the horse?Raise your hand if you don’t know what I’m talking about.",0
"It’s on the floor.  That’s okay, because we’re going to actually stop and I’m going to have you play the fraction track game with partners.  The three of you are actually going to work together because Student R is absent anyway, and so you’re sitting here, so I’m going to have you sit here and work on it together. So here’s what’s nice about this game.  Thank you for your help. Whose cards are these?  Is when you go to start this game. So pretend, Student J, you and I are partners, let’s pretend we’re going to play.  We can put these chips anywhere we want as long as they’re less than ¾.  So I just happened to tell you where I wanted them to be placed for this particular round, but you can place them anywhere you want as long as it’s less than ¾.  Can it be on ¾?",1
"Listen carefully; it can be less than ¾.  So can the chip be on?  No.  Any questions on how to play the fraction track game?  I have some directions for you that I will give you in case you get stuck.  So you will have a copy of this. You will need a copy of one fraction tract game board.  And you have your little markers.  What you might want to do – when you decide who your partner is, you’re going to decide whose fraction tract game board to use, and fraction cards, and I’ll come around and pass out the directions. You are to work with a partner that you don’t typically work with, that you don’t typically talk to, that you might not eat lunch with.  So the other day I was a little disappointed the way we picked partners.  And I need you to look around the room and really think about who you never work with. So, for example, Student L, do you usually work with Student C?  No.  Student C, no, not really.  I really only see you working with Student K, Student D, or…",1
"I already gave you one.  Did I give you directions in case you get confused?  You just need one set of the fraction cards. I’m going to count to 10 and you need to be sitting with your partner working.  1, 3… Do you have a partner?  Raise your hand if you do not have a partner.  Okay, look at all these people that do not have partners.  Okay, Student K, you need to find someone.  Student J, do you have a partner?  Who?  So Student G and M and H and K.  How does that sound?  That’s great.  Let’s get started.  Directions. Student G, do you have a partner, and do you?  Okay, there you go?",0
"Yes, of course.  You can talk.  We’re talking.  We just can’t see your face.  I can see your face.  So is this the new game board that we’re using?  Okay, where are the fraction cards that we’re using?  Did you mix them up?",1
"So you can split it up. You have a minute left. Hold on to them because you’ll need them for tomorrow.  There’s a part 2.  Go back to your desk please.  Make sure your fraction track cards… Student R, I’m waiting for you.  So Student D is ready. So I just want to go over our game that we played today.  What were some different moves that you and your partner may have experienced as far as breaking up fractions?  What were some moves that you can remember where maybe you were on one fraction and you had to really think about your strategy and how to get your chip to this one whole. Student R, come on up.  So tell us what happened.  Tell us where you were on the game, what fraction card you chose.",1
"So in that round you won two chips, that’s awesome, that’s a nice move.  Excellent. So tomorrow what you’ll notice is you’re going to have your whole game board open.  Student C, sit up please.  You’re going to have your game board open, so we are working up to two wholes.  Take out your agenda book please so we can go over your homework.",1
"So you think that she should add 3/8?  So this would be 1/8, 2/8, and 3/8.  And that would get her pretty close to winning this chip.  Anybody think differently?  Student A, you can come up here and use your finger on the screen so I can see what you’re thinking, hear what you’re thinking.",1
"Okay, so let’s go ahead and do it.  So you’re going to move the 2/4 – move off to the side so we can see the screen – so show us what you’re going to do.",1
"Yeah, but I have one chip.  Student C doesn’t have any chip. Okay, Student C, go sit down, and Student K come on up. So it’s my turn and I have chosen 1/10.  Can I go?",0
"So Student D is ready.Student C is ready.Student M, are you ready?I am coming around and I’m going to give you an index card.You’re going to want to tear up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 little pieces and you’re going to place them on the fractions that I have that are less than one whole.",0
"All right.  So here’s what I want you to think about.  Student K just picked 5/6, and I want you to break 5/6 apart and think about how many thirds we can get out of this.  So for example, I know that 1/3 is also equal to what?  I hear lots of whispering but no talking.  I know that 1/3 is also equal to what, Student E?",0
"No, you are working on your own tessellation. If you want to talk to a buddy that is ok.",0
"Sure. If you need more pieces there is a big bin. Here, you know what; I'll bring the big bin over here. Ok, come get them over here. Yep, come get them.",0
Don’t hit him please.,0
"Okay, yeah give me let me just work with Student S for just a minute.",0
Student R come here please. Student D come here please. Why am I calling you over here? Why am I calling you over here?,0
You weren’t just talking I’m okay with the talking what were you doing?,0
Uh-huh and what else? We’re you fooling around?,0
"Yeah. When I do stuff like this you have to be responsible for your own learning. That means that you’re sitting there trying to create a shape. It does not mean that you’re throwing pieces or fooling around in any other way do you understand? I don’t wanna hear you laughing from all the way over there. Okay sit back down please. Alright. You know what? So you wanna kinda tessellate them with these two just like this, sharing one square.",1
"It is it’s a lot of things to think about okay. Stop what you’re doing, stop what you’re doing. This is not what we’re doing. This is creating a design and I like your design but that’s not what we’re doing. What we’re doing is we’re creating a tile like that and we’re making a whole bunch more like that and we’re putting them together. Like is like one giant tile but that’s not really what we’re doing. Do you understand? Remember the patterns we had up here where they’re like repeating patterns? That’s what we need to do.",1
"No cause they have to have all the different colors represented in your actual shape. Like if they’re all blue diamonds yes but this could be a shape or this could have been a shape. Okay this is perfect now we’re gonna try something else. So we’re gonna bring all those triangles back. Help, don’t make a mess.",0
Excuse me I don’t want to hear this anymore. You’re doing okay cause we’re gonna copy it down in a minute.,1
It’s distracting to other people sweetheart you have to stop.,1
Wait without touching it try to see it in your head.,0
No. I think you guys need to stop doing that though and probably focus on your work. I’m not sure that can’t be right.,0
At twelve I think we’re done. Okay stop listen carefully. I’m about to hand out notebooks. What I need you guys to do is have a tile in front of you that has been able to tessellate. For you I would just do this because you can tessellate this. It’s okay we can just put one tile back it’s not a big deal. Just so you can practice.,1
If you have a space something should be in it. There should be absolutely no talking. Look around the floor make sure there’s no pieces around you.,0
This is going to be one of the centers that we’re going to have starting tomorrow. You are silent please. I should see everybody cleaning up. Is there a bag that these were in? Where’s the bag? Go get it and start putting these in there. Student C you need to be helping clean up.,0
"Yeah hold. Yeah hold on to that one, your tile hold on to everything else put away. Did you need help?",0
Okay if you wanna get one tonight at home you’re more than welcome to you don’t have to grab one from the back. If you would like to grab one from the back I’m going to let Student T’s table go first. Cause they were clean first.,1
"I didn't notice that at all when I did this. So, I was very impressed. Alright, so here is what I want us to look at. Are you listening?",0
"Exactly, exactly.  Any questions about where a fourth is?  All right, you know.  Here you go, folks.  You know that a one- fourth and a one-fourth equals a one-half. So when you’re measuring to a fourth, what are your options in between inches?  What are your options?  I need one person to raise their hand.  Not you, ‘cause you’re active and you’re doing a great job and I know you know.  I want to ask somebody who may be thinking about it.  What are your options over there, Student T?  When you’re – when I say to measure to the nearest one-fourth of an inch, what are your options?  Between inches.  Say your marker falls between an inch.  There’s the option of the inch, correct? What’s the next option?  One-fourth of an inch?",1
"What if it is bigger than a fourth of an inch?  Have a seat over here.  I’ll show you.  All right, I’m gonna jump to the paper clip, folks.  I’m gonna jump to the paper clip. All right, erase our definitions.  Okay, this is flush with the beginning here.  You with me?",0
"This is three-fourths.  All right, does anybody not understand it?  We’re dividing up this inch into different denominations.  When we divide – remember we showed you one- half.  What does the two mean in the fraction one-half? Student J, please pay attention, if you would.  Thank you. Put your papers away.  Thank you.  When we’re talking about half, what does the two mean?",0
"You’ve got to measure it.  You’ve got to measure it.  Huh? Student J, what’s happening?  What’s happening?  Okay, have a seat.  I need you to be measuring.",0
"No, one-eighth.  Student J, up here.  Turn around, put your feet on to the ground, up here.  What does it mean, one- eighth?",0
"I don’t know, I’m asking some pretty crazy questions today.  I don’t think my question asking is very good.  One-eighth. When you’re looking at a fraction, what does the denominator mean?  The denominator.  I’m just talking generally.  When you’re talking three-fourths, when you’re talking – excuse me.  When you’re talking three-fourths, when you’re talking five-eighths, when you’re talking nine- tenths, what does the denominator denote?  What does it mean, the denominator?  Yes?  It means the total number of pieces.  So when we’re talking about one-eighth, what we’re now doing is we’re dividing up the inch into eight equal parts, and from those parts we’ll have one-eighth, we’ll have two-eighths, three-eighths, four-eighths, five- eighths, six-eighths, seven-eighths and then we’re gonna have eight-eighths, and your job, should you choose to accept it, is to determine whether it’s closer maybe to six- eighths, seven-eighths or eight-eighths or whatever.  So let’s do it.  I need you to focus.  I need the talking to stop for a minute, ‘cause this is where the questions are gonna start happening.  Okay, are you with me?",1
Can you see it good enough or not well?,0
"Okay.  Where is it?  Okay, you need to write the next sentence. Put that other thing away, please.  Yes.",0
"Student J, do you see that?  Does everybody see it?  Student E? Student N?  Okay, now let’s go to the nearest half inch. We’ve marked the half inch marks.  Now you have to decide is it closer to the one and one-half inch?  Is it closer to the one inch?  Is it closer to the two inch?  Raise your hand.  Let’s have our hand raised this time.",0
"Okay, Student R, just for a second, check this out.  You may learn something here.  Check this out, Student K.  Okay, shh.  Okay, excuse me, hold on.  You need to stop talking for a second, please.  I know you’re sharing, and that’s okay, but I just want to ask this.  What is it?",0
"It’s one and three-fourths.  Do you see it, Student T?  Do you see it, Student A, Student S?  You do see it?  You divide that inch into fourths.  How about eighths?  Tell me where it is in terms of eighths.  Round it.  Student J?  Round it in terms of eights.  Please don’t do this.  These are not for this purpose.  They really aren’t, to destroy and undo and to stick into – it’s not what they’re intended for. It’s counterproductive to what we’re doing.  Are you having trouble dividing up that inch into eighths?  Student N, do you have it?  Can you divide that inch up into eighths now, ‘cause you were asking a few minutes ago, you didn’t quite know how to do it.",1
"Okay, you guys finish your chart, please.  Let’s get back to work.  We’re not done yet.  Yeah, we are, actually.  Okay.",0
"Sit down.Sit down.I want you to sit down, I want you to work on 11 and I need you to do it now.11 to 13.Please stop talking now.Stop talking now.Stop talking now, and I want you to practice – stop talking now.And I want you to practice 11 to 13.",1
"It’s page 412.No talking.Come on, you can do this.Let’s have you guys practice.Write your answers down and we’ll go over it.I don’t want to jump on to writing yet.Okay, I want you to get your ruler, Student J, and measure the blue marker in the book, and you’re gonna need your piece of paper.",0
"I want you guys to do it.We’re gonna discuss it.I got carried away with doing that.I really wanted you to do – make sure that you do this.Okay, go have a seat.You don’t need to be up here.There’s nothing on the board.Sit down.You all need to go back to your seats.",1
"Please.I want to make sure you guys know this.I know you do, I know you do.We had such a hard time with this last year.Maybe it’s because I didn’t explain it right.Shh, don’t talk.Don’t talk.I said don’t talk.I want you to – I want you to work.Okay, don’t talk, measure.",1
"Okay, don’t talk, measure.  I want you to measure that to the nearest – it’s 11, 12, and 13.  Measure it to the nearest inch, to the nearest half-inch and to the nearest eighth of an inch.  Put your pencil down when you’re done.  You’ve got to measure it, though, first.  Do not take this little skill lightly.  You need to know how to do this.  This is a skill.  It’s an AKS skill.  You have to know how to measure to the nearest eighth of an inch. Please don’t talk.  Student A, please don’t talk.  Put your pencil down when you’re done.  Have a seat, Student T. [Inaudible]  Anybody not done?  Okay, I need you to measure to the nearest inch – okay, please don’t talk.  You done, Student N? Okay, go ahead.  I need you to know how to do this.  I just spent an hour trying to explain it, now I need you to practice it.  You got it?  I’m particularly interested in what you say about the eighths.  Got it, Student K?  You measured?  You have your answer?  Okay, you having trouble? Okay, where’s your answers?  How come he’s not writing anything down?  Sit down, please. Got it, Student E?  Are you sure?  Okay.  All right, how many to the nearest inch?  Student J, how many to the nearest inch, do you think?",1
"Did anybody get anything other than three and a half?  How about to the nearest eighth of an inch?  To the nearest eighth of an inch, Student Q.  What is that to the nearest eighth of an inch?  No idea?  You don’t know what we’ve been doing for – you just have no idea.  You can’t – can you put this down and try to figure it out?  Put in just a little effort.  Just put in a little effort.  A little effort goes an awful long way in life.  Student A, what did you get for the eighth of an inch?",0
"Okay, can you not talk, please?  Okay, what did you get, Student M?",0
"Student T is correct when she says it’s three and three- eighths, and Student J is also correct, yeah.  That’s correct.  It’s – now, I want you to lay it down on there now and I want you to measure over eighths.  Please stop talking.  I want you to measure over – and raise your hand if you still don’t see it.  Student T, can you turn around and show him how that’s three and three-eighths?  No, behind you, Student T.  Just real quickly.  Just show him how that’s three and three-eighths.  Can you show her that that is three and three-eighths.  Did anybody else not get three and three-eighths?  Student L, what did you get?",0
"Well, you do.  One, two, three and one-eighth, two-eighths, three-eighths.  One and three-eighths.  Three and three- eighths, I’m sorry.  Okay?  You guys got it?  You got it? Okay, what – why?  What’s happening?  All right, go ahead, put your math away.  Sorry, we’re late on the math.  I take longer because I’ve struggled with this in years past.  Can we collect these?  Can you collect these and then come on back to your seats.",1
"You stole it, Student T.",0
"Okay, shh.",0
"All right, I’m going to then say 10 minutes silent lunch. Student T, I need it quiet right now.  I need it totally quiet right now.  And you’re still talking. We’re gonna have a silent lunch today.  I need it real quiet right now.  I’m not feeling any respect at all right now.  You’re still talking.  We’re gonna go 20 minutes. We’ll have a silent lunch.  Okay, we’re gonna do a silent lunch today.  Somebody else talks here in the next three, four, five minutes before I ask you to talk, we’re gonna stay in for recess tomorrow.  That’s how serious I mean it. Get out your DGP.  We’ve got things to do.  We’re wasting minute after minute here with this, ‘cause half of it’s my fault ‘cause I wanted to really make sure you guys got this – this measurement down.  Okay, I need you to switch gears into quiet right now. Okay.  You guys remember all of these.  Is there any part of this you don’t have?  This is what we did.  We corrected it, we put the capitals on it, have we not?  Have we not done the subject and predicate?  Have we not done the –",1
"Yes, yes.  Have we got any questions?  No?  Good, okay.  I’ll give you – I’ll give you about 10 minutes.  Oh, you’re talking about permanently, huh?  Okay, then you need to slide it back.  What is that all about?  Okay. Should be easy, shouldn’t it?  To the nearest inch, to the nearest half-inch, to the nearest one-fourth of an inch and to the nearest eighth of an inch.  Why don’t you slide right over here and work with her?  What is it you’re doing?  I have a thousand chairs back there.  Would you put the chair back, please?  Please.  I have chairs – I’ve got chairs, three chairs over there, two chairs there.  [Long pause]  How are you?",0
"Yeah, give some away?  Drop – yeah, please, if you would.  Drop some on different desks.",0
"Okay, you guys go to go have a seat back at your seat.",0
"Okay, but you need – your shoulder partner is who you ask questions of.",0
"Excuse me, Student P, you need to go have a seat.",0
"Thank you, thank you, thank you.Student J, this is your shoulder partner right here.Student J, this is your shoulder partner right here.Okay, have a seat.All right, can I have your attention for just a second?I’ve walked around a little bit and I have a couple of people asking some questions.",0
"And everything has to be divided equally, that's right.  Fair share, right.  Fair share, good. All right, let’s look at this number.  When we’re looking at the top number of a fraction, what's it called?  Raise your hand.  Raise your hand.  Student E?",0
"Eight, good.  Keep thinking about that.  Call on a boy. Student W, go ahead. Okay, timeout.  Nine-sixteenths, who can help Student W figure this one out?  Don't yell it out.  Who can help him think this through?  Don't tell him the answer.  Give him a suggestion to help him figure out where to put that.  Okay, can you give him a suggestion?  Student J, can you give him a suggestion?  Nine-sixteenths is what he’s looking at. What do we do?  Ooh, Student D remembers.  Student D, go ahead.  What are you doing?  What are you saying?  Shh, shh.",0
"So would that be less than one-half?  Eight-sixteenths would be one-half.  Nine-sixteenths would be greater.  You see that? So where should it be?  Okay, good.  Good, good, good. All right, call on a girl.  Student G, you with us?",0
"So he has one-sixteenth.  Let’s take a look.  One-sixteenth, definitely less than one-half.  All right, call on a girl. Sit up.  Sit up.  Sit up.",1
"Twenty-two, good thinking, good mathematical thinking. All right, so here’s what we’re going to do.  Each group – listen carefully.  A couple of things we’re going to do. Each group is going to get a container and there's some instructions on what to do.  Let me pass this out.  You are going to pick a partner.  So, let’s see, do we have any other - we have one absent today.  So you get to work by yourself, and you all decide who’s going to work with who. Two people to a group.",0
"Somebody at your group.  It has to be somebody at your group. Okay, so in your folder – listen – in your folder, is a sheet, a worksheet that you're going to have that goes along with what you have to do with your activity.  So pass out one sheet to everybody.  Mm-hmm, in the folder.",0
"Yeah, let’s not make – let’s just – Student S, sit up nice and straight.  Come on.  Turn around, get your feet under your desk.  Okay, will you move over here, or, Student D, you move over, one of the two.",0
"All right.  Hold on just a moment.  Now, are you two partners?",0
You are going to look at all of your fractions.  I’ll wait until you’re all listening.  Okay.  Ready?  Everybody listening?,1
"Right here.  Okay, let’s get going.  How come – have you been talking all this time, or are you just kind of waiting?",0
"Let’s focus on math, okay, focus on math.",0
"Okay, I’m hearing other things other than mathematics being talked about, so make sure you're just thinking math today.",0
"That's all right, just put it up.  Okay, Student S, I need you sitting.  Okay, can everybody stop talking just a moment? Okay, thank you. All right, we’re going to divide these up again.  Let’s see how you did this time. Student E?  Student E?",0
"All right, look up here.",0
"I’m waiting just for a moment for everybody to be ready.  I’m waiting just for a moment.  Student E, thank you for raising your hand.  What's your question?",0
"Okay, that's all right.  Let’s see if I can just figure out how to do this with fifths.  Let’s see, one, two, three, four, five.  Thanks for not talking over there.  Thanks for not talking. Okay.  All right, we have now a figure divided into fifths. All right, like a candy bar.  All right, here’s one-fifth, here’s two-fifths, here’s three-fifths.  Where would half be?",0
"Always.  So this would say greater than one-fourth.  Look right here.  I’m happy to have you ask questions, but then listen to the answers, please.  All right, this one says less than one-half, okay, so that’s what it says.",0
"No.  But let’s not turn them in, because we don't want to go past the camera.  But let’s just bring your papers right here, okay.  When you are finished with Round – I’ll say this again.  Some of you are talking.  When you have finished with Round 2 – Student S?  When you are finished with Round 2, please make sure your name’s on your paper, put it right here, okay.",1
"Okay, do we need to remind ourselves how to work in groups?  We cooperate.  We use – listen.  We use kind voices.  We help each other.  That's why we’re working in groups.  Let’s remember that.",1
"No, you may sit down.  We’re just about finished.  All right, quickly get these written out.  Quickly get these written out.  And if you have your manipulatives out, if you are not – if you do not need them for this project, please put them away, because we need every minute to get to our next activity.",1
"Shh, just wait.  Are you finished?",0
"Put everything away.  Put everything away.  And here’s what you are going to need to have ready.  Okay, are you working things out now?",0
"Then you should be listening, shouldn’t you?",0
"Okay, put all your parts away.  Put them back in the container. And here’s what I need you to get out, if you are finished.  I need you to get out your fraction bars that are in your containers, just the fraction bars.  Put them on your desk.",0
"No, do not put them in order.  I’m just going to ask you to get a couple of things.  Mm-hmm, okay.  All right, are you ready?  Are you ready?  Boys, get that put away, please. Put it back in your container.  Thank you.  Okay, ready? All right. Now, what we were doing with seeing whether fractions are less than or greater than or equal to one-half, we were comparing them, right.  We were comparing them  to one- half.",0
"Now, what we’re going to do now is also do a little more comparing but we’re also going to check on the ordering, which is bigger, which is littler, okay, and we’re going to do that through – somebody’s humming.  We’re going to wait. We’ll just wait. We’re going to do that through solving a problem by making a picture, all right.  So let me tell you what pictures you’re going to need.  All right, do you see these three fractions, one-half, three-fourths and two-fourths?  Do you see those?  Will you get your fraction strips that equal those three fractions?",0
"I really want you to be serious here, please.",0
"Okay, you’re going to have to work together.",0
"All right, here’s the problem.  Everybody stop talking. Everything stop talking and listen.  Are you ready?  Here’s the problem.  We have a table in front of us that says “Tortoise Training.”  We have three names.  We have Sammy, Henry and Jeb.  And we see that we’re talking about the yards they ran the first week.  Not too far.  Think about a half a yard.  Remember our yardstick.  Remember your yardstick.  Half a yard is not too big. Okay, half of a yard.  Here’s a yard, 36 inches.  Didn't run very far, did they?",0
"Equivalent fractions, yah.  All right.  All right, so let’s wrap this up, because it’s time to go.  While you’re putting things away, put all your fraction bars away.  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  Guys, come on, we just have a couple minutes left.  Hang in there with me.  Hang in there. All right, what did we learn today?  What did we do?  What did we do with our math activity?  Yes?",1
"Ah, excuse me.  We need to focus on what we’re doing now.  All right, I don't know if you can – I have this overhead and it has some number lines.  We’re going to use that if we need to.  But what our plan is, is we need to be able to write each fraction from the fraction bank – that's down here – in the correct column.  So do you see all of these? All right, I’m going to ask you.  I’m going to call on you. You get to pick a fraction and you place it in the correct column, all right?",1
"Okay, timeout, timeout.  Let me say it again and that's what we’re going to do.  Well, we’ll see if we have time for everybody.  But I’m going to call on you, see if you can come down, pick out your own fraction and determine whether it’s less than one-half, equal to one-half or greater than one-half.  Student G, come do the first one. Shh, shh, shh.  Pick one of those fractions, in the fraction bank, and then write it in the correct column.  Do you see the ones we’re talking about?  We’re talking in the box.  Pick one of those fractions.  See where it belongs. Okay, I see we’ve used the word equivalent to one-half. What does that mean?",0
"Are we talking about math?  Are we focused on the lesson?  So, let’s have Student J come up first.  For page C2, let’s choose for C2 number three.  Let’s choose number three.  We have 7 times 2, subtracting 3 plus 8, and we were looking for an answer.  Come on up, Student J.  Let’s have you do this work on the board for us.  Walk us through what you needed to do.  And again, remember over-post it on the board.  Student J, walk this way please.",0
"It is time to get ready to move to the next period of the day, and for us that is the bathroom and then computer specialty.",1
"A math glossary.  Do you have your in front of you?  Go in your math glossaries.  Please find the definition of what a square number is, ‘cause this is often where we get confused on assessments.  We’re using definitions that are incorrect.  You haven’t looked at your math glossary, Student R.  Please do so.  Does anybody want to stand and read for us the definition of a square number?  The definition of a square number.",0
"Go ahead, Student T.  Student T is working hard today.  She seems to keep answering.  Go ahead.  What’s your working definition that you’ve been using?",0
"Shh.  As a whole table, please.",0
"I love how table four is working so quietly together.  Very nice.  Thank you, table one.  You guys are doing an excellent job.  Thank you, table three.  Table three – Student M, I want you to participate.",0
"All right, I know that you are ready when I see your hands away from the sheet and your mouths are quiet.  What’s happening over here?",0
"Oh, it should still be on your paper, right?  Student M, [can you handle it], please?  Thank you.  Okay.  How many rhombuses cover Shape A?  Somebody we haven’t heard from yet.  Student S?",0
We can’t hear you.,0
"All right, stay on task.",0
"Tell her again, Student L.  She didn’t hear.",1
"I’m sorry, Student M raised her hand very nicely and she said I noticed something.  Now we should be giving her our attention.",1
"You could write two halves equals one.  All right, why don’t we stand, take a big stretch, [inaudible].",0
"I don’t see you guys working together, doing it.  Well, I don’t see it.",0
"Oh, I see table four is ready.  Table one, you’re ready. Student A, what are you doing, hon?",0
"You’re going ahead and that’s not the goal for this.  The goal, Student R and Student J, is for us to work on this together.",1
So I know when you’re ready because your pencil is down and you’re looking up.,1
"All right, guys over there, can you separate yourselves, please?  Student D, you too.  Student D and Student R. All right, let’s look at the trapezoid.  How much of the trapezoid – how many trapezoids – this is how you know. How many trapezoids cover this shape?  How many trapezoids cover this whole shape?  How many trapezoids cover this whole shape?  How many, Student Z?  How many trapezoids? All right, thank you.  How many trapezoids cover this shape?",0
All right.  Now I want you to work quietly with your partner to do number 12 on your own.  I’m giving you about two minutes.  Please begin.,0
Five triangles.  Just take a walk around and walk back to your seat.,0
"Right now [Inaudible] back in your seats.  One, two –",0
"And five.  That was good, except you guys did not need to run. That was not safe.  All right, let’s take a look.  Was that interesting to see all the different ways that people came up with?",1
Don’t forget to label them.  Shh.,0
"Are you copying his work or are you thinking on your own?  Why are you looking over there?  We’re on this page.  But we’re on this page.  This is Shape A, this is Shape B.",0
Just take out your book and read [inaudible].,0
"Okay, I see one person ready.  Two people.  Three, four.  Five people ready.",0
Six people are ready.  Okay.  [Pause].,0
"Student L, why aren’t you with us?  Go ahead, Student B.",0
"I’m sorry, let’s wait.  Let’s wait.  Are we ready?  Okay, are we listening?  Go ahead, Student B.",0
"That’s fine.  Why don’t you go now and we’ll do this – leave that there, leave that there.  All right, go.",0
"Raise your hand if you’re still waiting for more trapezoids. Okay, I think we’re good.  Thank you, Student D.  [Pause].",0
"Let’s try not to call out too much.  Student N, what fraction?",0
I do hear talking.,0
"I heard two people say triangle, and this is what I’m going to say about that.  I didn't call on anyone.  It’s great that you know what it is, but I did not call on anyone.  So wait until I call on you, because you may have it wrong.  Yes?",1
However best fits on your paper.  Let’s hold off with the questions right now.  Let me get a name for this one. Student G?  What shape is that?,1
"She had her hand up, let her talk.",1
Could we have it quiet?,0
"Don’t worry about any others because for today’s exercise we’re only using these three.  We can talk about it one on one. So at this point, can I have everybody stand?  1, 3, once we’re quiet, let me finish this and then we can talk, okay? Once we’re quiet, I’m going to have you guys go back to your desks.  1, 2, 3. Student R, everyone else is in their seat, and you’re standing here on the blue carpet.  Can you come back up here? There will not be a raffle this week, and from this point forward if I have to hand out several of my forms for your parents to sign, we will do that, and I do have enough of those here. I’m not going to go over what you guys should do when I put you back in your seats.  I’m not going to go over it again. So there will not be a raffle tomorrow. Would you take out your math journals, part 2, and turn to page 196. We can do this without talking.  I only see right now one hand up, so I’m only going to respond to that one person. Student M?",0
"You four can work together.  [Inaudible—too much noise from students.] Guys, we’re going to do one problem at a time.  I said that before. I’ll come around and double-check to make sure.  Can I have it quiet?  3-2-1.  This is going to be the format, guys. We’re going to go over the problem, I’m going to give you a minute or so to do the problem with the shapes, then we’re going to come back together quietly like we are right now. So number one says, “What shape is covered by one trapezoid?”  First of all, who can tell me – in fact, why don’t we do it this way… How many trapezoids are necessary to use to obtain our [inaudible]?",0
"We’ll see what happens. “Meanwhile, at an Inn on the other side of town, a weary young nobleman had just alighted from the Dover coach.  ‘Do you have a meal and a room for a weary young nobleman?’ he asked the innkeeper.  ‘Oh, Mr.  Nobleman, replied the innkeeper, your honor, my humble lodgings…’” Of course, you’re reading as Daffy Duck here, “’They are humble,’ the nobleman agreed, ‘aren’t they?’ That evening the young nobleman paid a visit to Lord High Chamberlain and requested an audience with fair Melissa.  But before he could see her, the Grand Duke rushed into the room.” Would you, Student M, have a seat behind Student R? “’We mustn’t have the wedding tonight.  I have heard that the Scarlett Pumpernickel is about.’ He turned to the young nobleman, ‘Who might you be?’ he asked.  ‘Perhaps I am the Scarlet Pumpernickel of whom you speak,’ replied the young nobleman.  The wedding took place later that night, but there was one uninvited guest – it was the Scarlet Pumpernickel.  ‘Save me, Scarlett,’ cried Melissa, ‘save me!’ ‘I will save you, Milady Melissa,’ the Scarlet Pumpernickel assured her.  ‘After them,’ screamed the Lord High Chamberlain, ‘they must not g-g-g-g-g- escape!’ ‘Halt,’ said the Grand Duke, ‘bar the way.  If you want the fair Melinda, you will have to fight me.’ ‘Must I?’ asked the Scarlet Pumpernickel.  ‘You must,’ replied the Duke.”",0
"Okay, and who can remind us what a friar is?  There was a question yesterday.  I’m only going to call on people who have raised their hands, because they know that that’s the thing to do in order to speak.  Student R?",1
"And you’re right, it’s Bugs Bunny.  Quiet right now so I can read this other paper. What she says and he says.  “Hey, stop, it’s only a movie.”",1
"We’re going to sit like we always do, we just come down here first.",0
"In the future we won’t have them because you’re going to have it out, so you don’t need to worry about how it is now. You shouldn’t have had it out here on the floor to begin with. Today what we’re going to do is talk a little bit more about how fractions fit in with shapes, and we’re going to continue with adding and subtracting fractions.  I’m also going to deal a little bit more with multiplication.  So I’m going to call you guys to the floor, go over a couple of things here, and we’re going to do something a little different. We’re going to work in groups, but it’s not going to be a game today.  So let me see which table is going to be coming down first.  Wolves can come down first.  Jaguars. [Inaudible] so that you can all see this.  Falcons can come down. Can we all stand up?  Who can tell us how we’re going to move from our desks to the floor?",1
"Yes, and we can add quickly to that as well.  Can we all go back to our chairs?  [Inaudible]  Falcons.  Jaguars.  We’re doing the same thing that we just did two minutes ago.  And now the Wolves. So far we’ve talked about multiplying fractions when they’re either proper fractions, like ½ times ¾, and Student S, what is the answer to this fraction?",1
"So, I’m going to make a design, over here.  I’m going to ask you to stop playing with the shapes, and I’m going to then ask Student A to duplicate, or make the same shape on the other side of the symmetry.  And that will make a mirror symmetry.  Okay?  Hold on, just a second.",0
"You got your mirror symmetry.And the next one would be your blues.And then these two would match as well.You did a good job, Student A.Thank you.I’m going to ask you to sit down.Okay.Everybody.What we’re going to do, today, is you are in partnerships, right now.",0
"You don’t need a marker.  I think you can just do it with your pencil.  If it’s easier with a colored pencil, we can do that.  What?  We’re going to be passing these out, yes. So, give – let’s see.  Just split these up.  There only going to be able to have, there only going to be able to have about three or four shapes apiece to do this.",1
"It’s all right.  It’s okay.  No, we’re doing it already.  You can [inaudible] right away.  Sit down, please.  Sit down, please.  All right.  Each group will have a number – why don’t you begin on your line of symmetry?  I’m waiting for Student J.",0
"It’s okay.  One person.  Decide who starts first.  You’re only working on one at a time.  One at a time.  So, Student A, you’re making a design when you get these, and then he’s matching it on the other side.  Okay?  You don’t have to use the whole page.  You can make a line of symmetry here. You can make smaller shapes.  Put them all together, Student J.  Put them – all the shapes together.",1
"Okay, so you’re all using one line of symmetry at first.  Why don’t we start – excuse me.  One.  Two.  Three.  Eyes on me.",0
"We’re going to ask you not to call out, Student I.",0
"There’s another thing on the side.  You’re just using this, and making a line of symmetry.  Can you sit down, please, Student R?  Student R, I can’t get by you.  Can you pull in, please?  You need to sit correctly, because I can’t get by you guys.  Pull in, please, Student J.  All right.  If you want to outline these with a colored pencil, or marker, you can do that, if it’s easier to see.",1
"Okay, I’m going to have everybody sitting and working.  Honey, you got to pull in your – your paper is on the floor.  Do we have more hexagons?",0
"Okay.  So, you can continue off of it, and what else?  Won’t it be easier to figure out what’s happening on the other side? I think it would be easier.  Then you’ll have – wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no.  We’re working on one sheet of paper.  This is just an extra for later, okay? She’s doing this.  You’re not using these shapes.  Is that your shape?  So, now, you need to match it up on the other line of symmetry.  No, honey.  There’s your line of symmetry, right?",1
"Go.  I don’t know if you were in the picture, or not, so. Okay.  You can’t be in the picture, so stay close to that wall.  Okay.  Excuse me, guys.  What are we doing?",0
"Student E, you’re working with a partner.  Come over here, and work with her.  Or, come over there, and work with Student E [inaudible].  All right.  You need to draw a line of symmetry.  I don’t know why all these are out.  I already had the shapes out.  You need to put all these back in. All right.  Come over here.  All right.  So, what you’re doing is, Student E is drawing a line of symmetry.  These are all for later.  All right.  So draw a line of symmetry, first.  Student E, you’re drawing a line of symmetry.  All right, so she’s drawing a line of symmetry, so.  And you’re building a shape off of that.  And then, what Student W will do, is she’ll do a mirror symmetry on the other side, and then you’ll outline it, okay?  So, I’m going to ask you to – once you outline it, to call me, and I’ll come back and tell you if we’ve got it right.",1
"And you’re working on the second one.  I’ll ask Student M again, and Student J, who are sitting down and paying attention.  I’ll ask Student A, and Student E.  Have you done two symmetrical shapes?",0
"All right.  [Side comments to one student about seeing the nurse].  Student J, while you’re waiting, can you come over here, and do this?  [Inaudible].  Yeah?  You have to be very careful not to – Student J - Student J, why are we here?  Student J?  Is this your group?  You need to go with your partner.  Right now.  Okay?  You just [inaudible] the paper up here.  Just go get the paper.",0
"Good.  You’re a smart girl.  Here we go.  Nope.  It’s okay. Yeah.  It’s okay.  We’re just going to.  We can check.  It needs to warm up.  We’ll see.  You can just line it up, there.  All right, I’m going to give you about three minutes.  Nope.  Not time yet.  I’m going to give everybody one, two, three, eyes on me.",1
"I’m going to give everybody about three minutes to finish up either their symmetrical shape, or their asymmetrical shape, okay?  Meaning that it’s not symmetrical.  Okay? So, I want to show that we’re using the document reader, up here.  So, everybody needs to have these outlined in a color so that we can see them.  We’re going to have to – you need to move, and we need to move everything back. Move that desk back, please [inaudible].  How many people are still working on their symmetrical shapes?  All right. Let’s get a move on.  All right.  You need to take your chair out of there.  Okay.  Good.  Let me see the bottom, then I’ll look at that in a minute, Student I. [Inaudible].  Some of them only look like it’s [inaudible].",1
"I’ll try again.On one.In your seats, Student J, and Student J.  I’ll wait for Student J, and Student J.  I’ll wait for Student I to kind of patrol it, please.I’m waiting for eyes from Student W, and Student E.  Everybody is quiet and done with your paper.",0
"I’ll take these, over here.I will ask you not to play with it – these things while we’re at – why don’t you go over and start collecting these, so we don’t everybody playing with them.",1
"Yes, Student L, go with him, please.  Go, take the buckets, and pick these all up, okay?  Okay, we should be done drawing it at this time.  Okay, then write that it’s not symmetrical.  And write your names, okay?  Make sure that they show a line of symmetry.  Everybody has to have a line of symmetry that we can build off of.  We try – and they’re coming around to collect these, now.  Somebody keeps turning off my light.  Can we leave it on for a minute, please?  Please collect all of your shapes, so that when they come around, you can just put them in the container. All of your shapes.  Get them in your hand.  They’re putting them into the container.  All vehicles are away.",0
"Just pick them up, and put them in the container.  Pass the container.  Pick them up.  Put them in the container. Student L will take it around.  Please pick them up, Student D, so you’re ready when they get here.  Student M, please pick it up, so that you’re ready when they get there.  Thank you.  All right.  Put the rest of those in the container.  And then I want eyes from everyone.  Thank you.  I think we’re done, here.  Student L, just go up and get it from Student E.  Okay, honey, just leave it.  Don’t [inaudible].  Student M, we’re collecting them, and putting them in the container.  All right.  One.  Two.  Three. Eyes on me.",1
"I’m going to ask everybody on the count of three to sit in their seat.  On one.  Student J.  On two.  Student J.  And on three.  Everyone is in their seat.  Thank you, Student R.  Just cover it up.  Put it over here.  There should be no more shapes, or anything in anyone’s hands.  Just right here.  That’s great.  Thank you.  Okay.  So, let’s all look up here.  We’re going to turn that light off, Student L. [Inaudible] on the right.  And I want you to be able to share with me what you think – this is – the first one is done by Student J, and Student L.  Who could tell me what they think about this shape?  Is there a line of symmetry? Student M?",0
"All right, so let’s see if somebody over here – I can’t have you up, Student I, because you can’t be videoed, but Student M, do you think you could draw it, so that it would show what it should look like, as if it’s symmetrical?  So, in other words, if I would fold it, what would it look like on the other side.  That’s what we’re looking for, right?",1
"All right.  How many people think that – here’s a line of symmetry.  Try not to move it.  [Side comments about touching].  There’s a line of symmetry.  I’m going to wait until it’s quiet.  We’re not talking over fourth graders. I’m waiting for Student J to put his head up and show ready position.  Student J, what do you think about this?  Do you think it’s symmetrical?",0
"Is there a hexagon?  No, there no – okay, sit down, please.",0
"Okay, hold on.  Okay, It’s just not dark enough for us to see, I guess.  Okay, wait, wait, wait.  Could we just leave it alone?  Can we just not touch it?  Okay.  Just leave it alone.  I’ll handle it.  All right.  So, she does, I guess, have a hexagon, up here.  All right?  I didn’t see that. No, here’s the hexagon, here.  All right?  There’s your hexagon.  Now, my question is, what happens … what happens here?  Do we lose it, here?",0
"The windows.  So, if you cut the windows down in half on the door, and you flipped them over, they would be exactly the same.  All right?  Okay.  So, today I’m going to ask everybody to pay attention, and be very quiet, okay, so that they can hear us.  Okay, so today you’re going to be making two symmetrical designs with your partner.  And if we have time, you’re going to make one design that is not symmetrical.  But I want to talk about what’s symmetrical, first.",1
Why are you reaching over her?,0
Say it nice and loud.  Say it a little louder.,0
"Thank you.  When you're finished, put your pencil down into your pencil holder so that I can see you're ready.  Student S, where's your math notebook?",1
"Okay.  Usually they're filled in.  Usually your 100 charts are filled in.  Grab a couple tissues and bring them inside, okay?  They're usually filled in.  These are blank.  We have to fill them in ourselves, okay?  If each of these pages has 100 squares, okay?  Each of these pages has 100 squares, how many of these pages do you think we will need to make our 1,000 book?  Turn and talk to a partner.  Tell your partner.",0
"Student J, join Student J and M, please.  Thank you.  All right, bring it back.  Bring it back.  Bring it back.  What did your partner say?  Tell us what your partner said. Student S?",0
"Okay.  Student C, you're on the cord, please.  You're on the cord.  Can you move that, please?  Student B, move over a little more.  Do me a favor?  You move that way a little more, and, Student C, you move that way a little more please.  Thank you.  And when she's finished, you can just use that.  That way we don't pull a plug out.  We're going to go over it in a second, a few seconds.  Okay, any volunteers?  Any volunteers?  These are our new vocabulary words.  Volunteers?  Student L?",1
"Okay, thank you.  So we are going to need 10 of these pages, 10 of these pages.  Now we know we need ten pages, but now we have to think about how – come on around.  You can come on around.  You can put that down and have a seat.  Now we need to think about how we are going to start on each page, okay?  No matter what, you have to have a first number and you have to have a last number, okay?  And we cannot fill in more than – we're not gonna fill in every single square.",0
"Okay.  Can you move over here, please, from behind the desk? Thank you.  Go ahead.",0
"You agree with Student A?  Okay, Student J, have a seat, please.",0
"Okay, have a seat.  Have a seat, please.  Yes, Student G?",0
"I'm sorry.  My people over here, you're not excluded from paying attention to the lesson.  You still have to look at the lesson.  You're still going to do the work.  So the paper, you have to stop.  Go ahead, Student A?",1
"Student J, I would love for you – what did Student A just say? They know what they're supposed to do.  You need to pay attention to what's going on over here, okay?  What did you say, Student A?",0
"Sh.  Let her think.  Student S, do you see any patterns happening?",1
"Now, whatever number you choose, whatever landmark number you choose, you have to remember that if I were to ask you a number, you need to be able to use the landmark numbers that you chose, go right to the square, and – Student J, if you're not going to pay attention, you can sit over there, okay?  All right?  Okay.  Whatever number I ask you to choose – I mean whatever number that I ask you, you should easily be able to go in this chart and find it. And I'll tell you, in the past I've had children, students, choose numbers just because it is comfortable, but they just think, oh, this is a high number and it's comfortable for me.  Just gonna choose that.  And then when I ask them to go and pick the number, they have a hard time finding it. I need you to be able to just look, see that you have a number somewhere and be able to know where the number that I asked you for is located in your chart, okay?  Yes?",0
"how many people used Student E's strategy?  Okay, all right. Thank you.  All right, so we're going to get started with our books.  We're gonna get started with our books.  Before we move on, I’ll answer questions.  But we're gonna get started.  We have to get off of the carpet.  We've been here for a long time.  Okay?  Do you have a question?",1
"Student M, can I have you help please?  Can you please put your SABs away?  Put your SABs away.  Put your SAB and your math notebooks away?  I'm only calling people are efficiently sitting quietly.  Student J, come over and help please. Every person needs to get 10 of these, okay?  Ten.  Thank you.  As soon as you get your paper, your blank 100 chart, you can begin.  How many pages are you supposed to get?",1
"Ten.  Do me a favor.  Go out, pass those around.  Thank you. Student S, can you please grab one, two, three clipboards and bring them over here please.  Thank you.  Yes.",0
"Which is why it was very important for you all to pay attention to the lesson.  Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Yes sir?  Hm?  Can you do it too?  Do you want to?  You do? Let me see if I have enough sheets, okay?",1
Did you ask her if it was okay that you touch her property? No?  She didn’t like that you were in her space.  Okay? Yes?,0
"Seven, eight.  Yes, do me a favor, Student T, come.  Can you go downstairs and ask them to please make – ask for 20 of these.  Okay?  Twenty.  All right?  From Mrs. F.  Take the pass with you.",0
Raise your hand if you need me and I'll just come by.  Yes?,0
"If you count by twenties?  You can count by twenties, that's fine if that’s a comfortable number for you.  The question is is if I ask you where 74 is, if you're counting by twenties, will you be able to find 74?  Student B?  Student C?  Sorry, yes, okay.  Okay, yep.  Student B, do me a favor.  Take that.  Put that in your bag.  Go around that way.  Yes?",0
"Because there are 10 columns?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten?  Ten columns?  Okay.  Thank you.  I would love raised hands.  I don't want you to sing my name.  I would love raised hands and patience and I'll be right over to you.",0
"Okay, twos.  We can add twos to landmark numbers because two are a comfortable number to count by also.  Very good.  I like that thinking.  And I see people agreeing with you, Student D.  Okay, all right.  So if I can have you just come over here to the carpet.  Do not sit behind the camera.  Just come right here to the carpet.  Is everybody in?  All right.  Okay.  So over the next couple days, you're going to be making a book that counts all the way up to 1,000, all the way up to 1,000.  And this thousands book is going to help us to find numbers in order to solve problems that go up to 1,000, and it will help us see how the number system works.  Questions?  Any questions?  Yes?",0
"Yeah, Teacher B will be happy to know that you already started. Okay, on these manila colored sheets, please – one, two, three all eyes on me.",1
"Listen to my words.  We have a couple days in which we will be working on these.  I'm not expecting everybody to be finished today.  We have a couple days in which we will work on them, okay?  So don't worry if you're not finished. You have a couple days.  Just make sure they're in order. Make sure that you place them in between the two pieces of construction paper.",0
I am coming around with paperclips.  Give me two seconds. There you go.  You're welcome.  I'm wondering who's going to be quiet so that we can be efficient because we still –,0
"A hundred chart?  This?  Here you go.  Raise your hand if you still need a paperclip.  Student M, can you go around and collect these books, please?  Thank you, Student M.  You need another paper?",0
Let's see who is ready to write their homework down because we have like three minutes.,1
"I'm sorry, Student A, you are being very rude right now.  You keep interrupting his thinking.  That's not okay.  Thank you.  Sorry, Student E, go ahead.",1
If you're finished.  Just wait patiently.  Give a minute.,0
Listen to them reading so you can solve it.  You guys are awful loud over there.  Are you sharing your strategies?  Okay. She has an apple truck.  She's driving an apple truck.  I know.  Why don't you come over here?  They're working really hard on solving a problem.  Why don't you come over here and listen to Student J?  So come over here.  You can listen.  Ready?,1
"You guys worked so well together.I'm going to pair you up together in the future.That was awesome.Maybe he will, maybe he won't, but if he is, you guys are a team.You guys are a thinking team.That's awesome.I want you to do these two on your own now.",1
"I'll take that.Thank you.You can have a seat.Thank you.Have a seat.When you're done, I'm taking your markers.Thank you.Student J, have a seat, Student J.That's three, maybe four times I just said that.How many – wonderful.When you have a seat I'll be giving you a ticket.",0
"I'm going to move you to the front.All right.If you have a seat, I can give you a ticket.Student T.  I'm going to put it down here so everybody can see.Thank you.Student J, you got one?I got it.Thank you.Have a seat.Student A?Beautiful.Student T?",0
"Perfect.  I couldn't ask for anything more, guys.  This was the best, the best, the best.  Thank you.  Give yourself a round of applause.  [Applause]  Thank you.",0
"Think about all of the story problems we've solved over the past couple weeks.There are 300 tires.How many cars can I make with 300 tires if there's 4 tires per car, things like that?Remember?Are you guys talking?You know what?He has his notebook out.",0
What about them?  What about the Christmas trees?  I love your focus today.  Are you looking for tree?  Are you spelling your name or tree?,0
"All right.  So we’re running.  Today in math, let’s look at the objective.  Students will be able to use doubling and halving strategies to solve multiplication problems.  So do we remember our doubling and halving strategies?  Put your hand up if you remember them.  Okay.  I want us to look at two problems.  Now, I don’t want us to solve these problems.  I just want you to look at them.  Just look at these problems.  Now, what do we know about these problems? What can someone tell me about these two multiplication problems that we’re going to know, Student K?",0
"96.  Student C?  All right.  Go sit at the back table.   So just because you guys aren’t on camera doesn’t mean that you still need to do the math work, okay?  Just because you’re not on camera doesn’t mean that you can just sit here.",1
"So if I wrote this problem – all right, raise your hand if you think that the product of this multiplication is going to be bigger than this one.Raise your hand if you think this is going to be bigger than this?So a couple.Raise your hand if you think this one is going to be less than this.",0
You don’t want to?  [Inaudible] independent with them?,0
"Multiplication.  So rather than adding 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 until we’re done, we can just multiply 16 times 3, because we have 16 boxes.  Student J, can you sit right there next to Student C?  All right.  Now, so we have the story problem and we drew a picture.  Who can tell me something they know about the product?  Remember, the product is the answer to a multiplication problem.  What are we going to know about the products of these two multiplication problems?  Student S?",0
"168.  How many people got 168?  How many people got 168 for problem number 5?  Nice.  Nice.  So, let’s try to get through the rest of these.  We have three more problems. 30 times 16.  What one should we break apart.  Student M, can you go back please?  Thank you for helping her.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  What would be an easier one to split apart – the 30 or the 16?  Student W?",0
"Shh.  Raise your hand.  Shh.  Give me five.  Give me five.  How did Student L break up her problem, Student L?",0
"276.  All right.  Put these away, please.",0
"We already did that.  [Students talking to each other].  Okay. All eyes on me.  You have to – you already gathered your data.  Wait a minute.  Excuse – I’ll wait, Student D.",0
"Okay, you’re working in groups.  I need you all two to move down.  You’re working in groups.  Student S, move up.  Get your data [inaudible] book.  Don’t you see the camera is on, Student S?  Where’s – where’s your book?  Turn around straight.  What are you doing, Student C?  I didn’t tell anybody what to do.",1
"I’ll wait.  Listen.  You already – student R and Student B, stop.  Everybody stop.  I’m ready to tell – now stop.  You already gathered your information, right?",0
Begin.  [Students working loudly in groups].  [Inaudible].,0
"I said [inaudible] you weren’t’ here, but you [inaudible].  Why are you up, Student D?  We did that part.",0
Cake.  Ice cream.  [Pause].  Brownies.  Now look at this.  One. Two.  Watch this.  The title is going to go on this line. Now you – are you looking?  Because you don’t know what you’re doing.  You really don’t.  You’re not learning because [inaudible] just want to do.  How many people on your graph chose cookies?,1
So we’re going to make that [inaudible].  So – excuse me.  Pay attention.  Now [inaudible] you are.  How many people chose brownies?,1
"All right.  Now you can look.  How you follow this data is this.  You go all the way over here.  You [inaudible] – Student R, you really need to pay attention.  You do not know everything.  Over here.  You can read this data. Can’t you [inaudible] exactly [inaudible] see how only six people chose cookies?  Can’t you see it’s two, here?  Two here?  Can’t you see that’s eight up there?  Now -",0
"Now you write it out, “As I stated in my graph.  My graph shows favorite desserts.”  Go ahead.  So what does your graph – sit up [inaudible] – what does your graph tell you?  You should be down to your constructive response.  It’s 2:00. [Inaudible] how many people you have … okay.  [Students working on graphs in groups].  Sit up, Student C.  Okay, it’s time to share.",1
She’s not here and you weren’t [inaudible].  Sit down.,0
"Sit up.  Okay, what does your graph show?  Out of 18 people.",0
"It’s time to share.  Excuse me.  It’s time to share.  Student C, we’re not doing that.  We’re sharing.  One.  Two. Everybody should be finished.  Student D, are you through?",1
"[Inaudible] crayons.  No.  You always do the [inaudible] one. Teacher L, get the [inaudible].  Excuse me.  Let them share.",1
That’s great teamwork.  [Clapping]. [Students returning to seats].,0
Excuse me.  Excuse me.  The next group.  Let’s go.  The next group.  Excuse me.  Why are you talking?  Stay focused.,0
You ask.  You ask.  You go around and you ask questions.  Okay. Now all you all are going to do – that’s my data.  I just told you one.  Now I want you to make up a data.  I want you to get up.  Collaborate.  Work with your team.  I’m going to make the same.  Work with your team.  One person has to gather what?,0
"All, you all are working together.  What are you doing?",0
It’s the – I don’t see anybody asking – walking around and asking somebody.  You have to ask.  We have 28 people in the room.  [Students talking with each other].,0
"You have one data sheet.  [Students talking with each other]. No, but that’s for you to figure out how to do it right. What Student G is doing is wrong.  Look.  You have it over here.  Give me your books.  Student L’s is right.  Student S’s is right.  “My favorite food.”  [Students talking with each other].  Okay.  [Inaudible], “My favorite foods.” This side you have chicken.  Excuse me.  Look.  Shrimp. [Inaudible].  Are we looking?",0
"You go around and ask your … excuse me.  [Inaudible].  Focus. You go around.  Excuse me.  Oh, [inaudible].  [Inaudible]. Everybody to your seat.  [Teacher yelling].  Didn’t I say [inaudible]?  You don’t know [inaudible] and you move it. You’re going to make it into one.  After you – over here. After you get the information - Student J.  [Teacher with calmer voice].  After you get the information, then you got to get it into your graph.",0
"After you gather the information, Student K, Student S – because if I ask you what to do, you’re not even listening. After you get … after you gather the information, you have to turn it into a graph.  You walk around.  You ask people, quietly, how many people like – you all have favorite foods.  How many people like chicken?  How many people like -",1
"Okay.  Let’s do it [inaudible].  Shh.  They’re asking you. Okay.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Teacher L, can you fix your board to [inaudible] crayon.  Student D, you and Student D are not doing anything.  [Students talking with each other].  Okay, now go – after you [inaudible] it – Teacher L, can you fix the board?  [Students talking with each other].  Okay.",0
Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Just stay focused.  Now what kind of – look through your book.  What kind of graph should we do?,0
"Student P, will you hit the lights please?",0
Wake up.,0
"Waiting.  Waiting.  Yes.  Will you pick them up for me please? Thank you.  Okay, we’re going over page 76.  Ready?",0
Thank about that.  How many are there in the whole?  I’m in the middle of a group and you’re being rude and interrupting.,1
"Uh-oh, all right.  Student L let Student E try.  Okay, back to ours.  All right, number ten.  How would you do it Student T?",0
"No?  Okay.  Nothing to ask at all?  All right, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. It is about time to go to lunch.  We will continue after lunch.  What I need for you to do is put everything back nice and neatly so that way it’s easy for the next group.",1
"Thank you.  Once you are finished, I need you to line up. Thank you.",0
"Very good.  So these two are the same as [inaudible].  Very good guys.  I’m impressed.  Give yourselves a round of applause.  Okay.  What we’re going to do.  I have quite a bit of work for you to do, but I want to practice this a little bit, first.  So what I’m going to do is go over a few of the questions that are on your work, and also on your homework, so you can kind of get a feel for what it is we’re actually doing.  Remind me again, what is a variable? Tell me what a variable is?  Raise your hand.  Raise your hand.  Raise your hand.  You can put it in your own words. You don’t have to give me the exact definition.  What is a variable?  Student E?",0
"Great.  You’re scaring me with how fast your picking this up. Student W, put your hood down, please.  [Inaudible] this up.  Okay.  I’m going to do two on this side, two on this side, and then we’re going to do maybe three questions on [inaudible].  And then I’m going to give you the rest of the class to get this done.",0
"Quotient.  Very good.  And what is this word quotient telling you, Student K?  Hmm.  Student F, I’m not sure what you’re doing, but hurry it up, please.  [Pencil sharpening].  We have to divide.  Very good.  This word quotient is telling us that we have to divide.  Why?  What quotient is the answer to the division problem, right?  Okay?  So if this is the quotient of nine and X.  We’re on number two.  Don’t [inaudible] to number three.  The quotient of nine and X. Do you think that it could be nine divided by [inaudible]?",0
"Per.  And what does per mean?  Student Q, can you stop the chitter-chatter?  What does per mean?  Now, not like a kitty-kat.  Purr.  Per what?  Ten per box.  Or um, [inaudible] what operation is it going to be, Student A?",0
Raise your hand if you have an answer.,0
I’m going to wait until I see more hands.  Student E? [Inaudible] E.  [Inaudible].,0
"Student A, I need you to sit down [inaudible].",0
"To what?  And what do you need to do if you had my attention? If you needed my attention?  What, Student A?",0
"You’re welcome.  Student L didn’t show up, did she?",0
Does anyone else not have an exit ticket?  Does anyone else not have one?,0
Read it out loud to me.  There shouldn’t be any talking.,0
Shh.,0
"Four.  Very good.  Because seven minus four equals three.  So now, which other X up here is equaling four?  What X up here is equaling four?  Or equals four?  [Silence].  This is a good one.  Student W, eyes up here.  Student L?",0
"Student, G.  Student T, can you come here, please?  Bring your exemplars, and a pencil, also.  Come here.  All right. Now, what are we doing?",0
"All right, you’re good.  Go ahead and head back.  You can go ahead and head back.  All right.  You seem stuck to me. What’s the problem?",1
"Yeah, I can get you one.  Hold on one minute.  I’ll be right with you.  Yes, ma’am?",0
"We’re talking about the circle, Student X, you’re talking about the rectangle, it sounds like.  What’s another way to show the area of the circle?  Okay.  Then start over again, will you?  Hold on.  I’m sorry.  Guys?",0
"Remember, guys.  Another way to show it – there’s a lot of different ways you can go on that.  A lot of different ways.  So, showing it another way – if you bring in the diameter instead of the radius, you’ve shown a different way to do that problem.  Okay?  It’s sometimes that easy. Student D, come back with us, will you please?",0
"Anthony, you’re gonna leave if you do that again.  I mean it. You’ll leave.  You understand me?  That’s the first and last time that happens.  One more time and you leave, so just know that.  I’m sorry.  Say that again, Student H?",1
"Then guys, go ahead and clear off your desks, except for a pencil.  Thanks, sir.  Sit down, Student G.  Guys, clear off your desks, except for a pencil.  Is your name on it? Student A, just go take a book to Mr. Stort’s room.",1
So what are you waiting for?  The only person that should be waiting is Student E on me.  But it's like a jungle in here.  What's going on?  Do you have a panther in here? It's like the everglades.,0
"If you guys are good, I’ll let you see that lap again.",0
"I didn’t call you.  I wanted to, but you started talking. Hands up.  Student E and then Student T.  What is a landmark number?  Student J?  Student J, Student J, Student J.",1
"Okay, we're going to do the 283 first and then we’ll go to the 179.  With 283, how much do we need to add?  Student T, nice quiet hand.  How much?",0
"So Student J is taking notes, which I like, 'cause she's documenting a new strategy that she could use.",1
"Okay.  I would like everyone's attention.  Well, when you're done taking your notes.  Is everyone done taking their notes?  Would you like to play a game?",0
"So we have so many options.  That's what's great about this. As long as you're jumping the appropriate – excuse me.  As long as we're jumping the appropriate number, we're getting to our goal and we're getting the right answer.  Yes, Student D?  Nice quiet hand next time.  I can help you, yes.  Want to show us something?",0
"I know.  I know.  I'm going to each pair of people – and I’ll work with you, Student E – with these digit cards.  I'm going to give everyone a set.  Oh, you know what, actually you two are going to work together so you're going to have to get that odd and you're going to have to put those papers away, please.  You use one pencil.  You will need your math notebook and your student activity book.  You three will work together.  Everything else is away, Student M.  Student activity.  What do you need?  Two things?",1
"Math notebook.  Good.  Student M, we're losing time and I don't want to have to ask you to change your card.  Student T, if I see them again, they're all mine, all of them.  Away now. Two seconds.  One, two.  Oh, I guess they're mine.",1
They're mine for now.  No distractions.  So what are we getting?  What kind of cards?,1
"Yeah, don't worry about the wild cards.  Just put them to the side.  You're going to deal each of your members four cards.  No, I'm sorry, eight cards.  Eight.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Now I'm not looking at these so forgive me if they're wild cards.  You're also going to be looking at page 31, but that will just be in a minute.  And the rules of the game are every player gets how many cards?",0
"Eight cards.  With those cards, we're going to try to make three digit numbers.  Our three digit numbers are – now, if you get a wild card, which I have two of, I'm going to just put them to the side and grab two more cards.  So these are my cards.  I now have double.  These are my cards.  We are paying attention.  I'm sorry, Student A, you might have to explain the rules to your friends who aren’t paying attention.  Can you not do that with your chair anymore. It's going to be very loud.  You're going to try and make three digit numbers.  The trick is to make 2 three-digit numbers that are as close to 1,000, if you added them together, as possible.  Your goal is 1,000.",1
Don't worry about putting them back in the case.  It's not important.,1
"Let's speak kindly.  Student M, can I help you?",0
Let's see.  We're gonna run out of time before you guys finish if you keep talking.,1
"I would like – ding, ding, ding – everyone to sit down, number one.  Should not be out of your seat.  And you can go back that way.  I'm waiting for everyone to sit down.",1
"Maybe he was talking less and concentrating more?  I would like everyone to freeze.  Please put all – facing the same way – please put all the cards in one deck, one pile, and put the pile in the plastic bag.  You have a plastic bag?  No. There you go.  Make sure you're getting all of the cards. Some of them are hiding under your books, under your place cards.  Here you go, honey.  Sit down.",0
"Student M, give all the cards to Student J right now.  Give all the cards to Student J.  Student M, sit back in your seat. Boys, we do not need this control situation.  It's getting out of control, all right?  Lot of bickering over there. It needs to stop.  Lot of pencils on the ground too.  Got it?  Okay, thank you, madam.  That's okay.  I got it.  See, that was phenomenal.  Oh, I think I gave you guys too many cards.  I’ll have to redistribute them.",0
Put your head down.,0
"Student T, we'll listen when it's your turn.  What was that again?",0
Put it in your desk or it's going in my desk.,0
"I'm sorry, Student T?  Too much in the air.  I'm trying to listen to Student M.  Sorry.  One more time, Student M?",1
I'm sorry.  It is Student M's turn.  People are being very rude.  I hope people are keeping in mind how they would like to be treated when it's their turn.,1
"Can anyone repeat what he said?  Student M, could you repeat what he said?",0
Yes.  So I'd like you to put your student activity books away for now.  Thank you for your input and your responses.,0
And I'd like you to get everything off your desk.  We're going to do second step next.,0
"I would like you all to try to use a number line because I feel like that's our weakness right now.  We really don't use the number line that much.  And I'd like you to try to solve it that way.  Okay?  So Student E, I'm going to get your notebook for you.  In your notebook, not your student activity book – Student M, put your desk back.  Thank you. It is 179 plus 283.  Please write that on your paper.",0
"Student S, student activity book.  Oh, I have your student activity book.  Take out your notebook, your math notebook.",0
"Yikes.  What's going on here?  Student A, what are you doing?",0
"The 8 stands for the amount of flowers.  Student R, stop.  You have to go sit next to Student J.  Please.  Without complaining, go sit next to Student J.  So the 8 stands for the amount in each row.  What operation is this?  Student M?",0
"No.  You’re not going to work with someone yet.  Take one and pass it, please.  You need one for you, one for James. Take one and pass it, please.  [Inaudible] microphone. Student T, turn around, please.  This is going to explode, it’s so frozen.  Put your mouth right on it.  I know you have a cold, but –",0
"Yeah.  Can you wait until we’re done with this one?  You’ll just have to copy it, but just wait.  Student D, what are the dimensions of this array?",1
"Hmm?  Shh, Student D, stop.",0
"Yeah.  B is actually the 10th multiple.  So if we took B and doubled it – 260 plus 260 gives us 520, because the 10th plus the 10th gives us the 20th.  Okay?  I’d like you to do these, or start this on your own, please.  I’m coming around.  If you would like to work with someone next to you – no one’s leaving their seats – but if you want to work with someone next to you, you can.  If you have a question, you can ask them if I’m working with someone else and you need help.  I can already see Student S and Student B have started working together.  You can all start working now on this.  Yes?",0
"Okay.  Let’s do this.  Want to start with this one?  No, not really, I guess.  All right.  Can you show me how you solve that?  Student T, can you please stop?",0
"8 times 30.  And who can tell me what the dimensions of this array are, Student B?  8 times 7.  Take one minute to solve this, please, and then I’ll call on someone to answer.  If you need help, raise your hand.",0
"Let’s go.  Get your math stuff out.  Go move your desk, right back up.  All right.  Back up a little bit.  Okay.  Back up a little bit.  Pull your chair in, Student R.",0
"All right.  Who can tell me how to solve this?  Turn your body, please.  Student J, 8 times 30?",0
"Build it for me.  Let me see.  That doesn't look like that. Silence from you two.  Next word I hear from either one of you, you go on the board.  You're talking nonsense.  I'm coming back, so keep going.  I'll come back.  Nice work. You need to label the right angles.  Have you labeled the right angle?  Can you fill in Student S on what we're doing?  It's tricky.  You made the same shapes, just a different size.  One of those is okay.  Does that have a right angle?  When people don't try, that's when I get a little upset.  Put those together and what do you get? Where's the right angle?  Right in the middle there.  All it takes is trying, right?  You need to be putting shapes together.  You cannot use just one.  Where is your right angle?  You have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  You have six right angles right there.  You have about five more minutes.  You should have at least six shapes with right angles.  That one's too big.  What about try these?",1
"Yeah.  Which side is which?  You cannot label these right angles because they are not.  Which side is your right angles?  This is good except these are not right angles. These are okay, but you cannot use this square for right angles.  You need to have it curved.  If you draw it like that, you're telling me it's a right angle.  So go back and fix, because this right here is not a right angle.  It's an obtuse.  These are not right angles. You can't have the square.  You need to have it be curved.  That's not right. It's acute.  When you're finished, put the shapes away. All right.  That buzzer is going to ring in 30 seconds. All right, boys and girls.  I've clapped four times.  If you're continuing to talk, initials will go on the board. Eyes up here in 3, 2, 1, 0.  Student J, I don't see your eyes.  Initials will go on the board.  Student E, I don't see your eyes.  I called for all eyes up here and I gave you a count down.  There's no reason why your eyes could not be up here.  This is the shape we originally started with, and how many right angles did this shape have, Student R?",1
"I'm only asking right now for shapes that have one or more right angles.Friends that have their friends up, when I call on someone, you're not going to start moaning and groaning.We're going to do more than one.First I would like Student M, your hand is not up, but I know you have some.",1
"Thank you.  Change it back to its owner and count how many you got right.  If you are not ready when I call your name, you do not get a star.  So 10, 9, 8, 7, don't put it away. You're going to make one pile. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.  Voices go off.  Student J?",0
"Which one?  This one?  This right here is not a right angle? I'll give you one minute to get those pieces in the bag. Anyone who is still fumbling around with pieces in one minute will have classroom consequences.  40 seconds.  Not right now.  30 seconds.  There's pieces on your desk still. 20 seconds.  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, we are not doing a nice job listening to directions, 1, 0.  Okay.  All polygon pieces are away.  If you still have them in your hands or on your desk, you are not following directions. If you are still talking – Student P, you are not even close to following directions.  Reading a book is not directions.  I can't wait to send this video home to all your parents.  You just made a comment.  Really think about speaking before raising your hand.  How many right angles does Student A's shape have, Student Z?",0
Why are they obtuse?  Who can help Student M out?  Why are those two angles obtuse angles?  Raise your hand.  Student G?,0
"Sit down.  What is the measurement – you can do it after – what is the measurement of a right angle?  Raise your hand. Student A, what is the measurement of a right angle?",0
"Raise your hand if you think we met both of our goals for today.If you're not raising your hand, you're not listening to my question.We just went over the fact that we met both of our goals.Raise your hand if you think we met both of our goals today.",0
"No.That means when I call your group, you're going to walk over to the recycling bin and recycle it, or you can put it in your green math folder.Then you can continue to work on your division coloring piece from this morning.You may not read.",0
"The first group that can sit in their chairs straight, already be working on their division coloring piece, will be called, and can do so silently, will be called to bring their papers.Of course.The group that can do this the quietest will get some extra points.",0
"Throw your paper away if you'd like, or you may keep it.There's the library.Some groups won't be getting the bonus points.Stop that, please.It's really distracting.Student M, will you go around and collect these?Make sure the bags are sealed so the pieces don't fall out.",1
"One pile on your desks, please.  Put everything away now.  Our math lesson is starting.  Student A, will you collect them please?  You need to be focused on this question.  Ask me once more and your name goes on the board.  Student A is collecting them.  All right, boys and girls.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.  Eyes up here, please.  I'm at 0.  Put it on my desk. Student P, are you still talking?  Yes or no?  Going to keep it up?  I don't see all eyes from the Nikes.  Who can tell me what this shape is called?  There's three different names we could call this shape.  Student A, what is one?",0
"It has four corners, and what are those four corners called? Raise your hand.  I have my shape.  We've called it a square, a quadrilateral, a rectangle.  What do those four – now Student A, are you talking about this, or are you talking about that?  Which part are you talking about, this point or this square?",0
"Please don't ask me for bathroom or drink during this lesson. Who can remind me what it means to have a right angle, Student A?",0
"Now last week, Student A, we used these polygons.  What did we do with these polygons last week?  Student T, eyes up here. What did we do with these polygons last week?",0
"Creating angles by joining two or more power polygons.  Student T, you must have your eyes up here.  We're going to be identifying angles and creating angles.  We're not doing fast math this morning.  Now if I hear any complaining, I'm sorry.  That's just how it's going to be.  Student T, your name will go in the book because you're just being disruptive now.  We're going to be creating two or more angles by joining the power polygon.  You're going to get this blue paper.  You'll notice it's the same on both sides.  On the front side I want you to work to create shapes with right angles.  So on the front you're only going to be working on right angles.  Student P, what's the only angle you're worrying about on the front?  Right angles.  So when you get your paper, if let's say this is the shape that you made, you would draw the shape on your paper.  Okay.  This shape would be in one of your boxes, and because we're only worried about right angles, you're going to show me the measurements for right angles.  What's the only measurement we're worried about on this front side, Student A?",1
"1, 2.  You do not have to draw on the dotted line this time. You're just drawing me your new shape that you made.  So when you and your partner get these polygons to share, please make sure they don't go on the floor.  You're going to have 15 minutes to work on the front side, and then we'll share.  I will certainly sharpen the pencil.  I'm going to set the timer.  You better be getting yourself in control.  Do you understand?  Look at me.  It's embarrassing.  Everyone is going to see that, how out of control you are.  Hang on.  I can see your hand. [Inaudible].  Just so you know, everyone is seeing you out of control.  You too.  Student N, come get some for you and Student T.  Right angles, acute angles, obtuse angles, okay?  All right angles on the front.  What?  I would just be self conscious at this point.  I don't see you working. I see you talking, not working.  You're supposed to make right angles.  You can't just draw one.  You have to put them together somehow.  Stop, because you're not following directions.  You have to put the shapes together.",1
"You sure?  You know how we can check?  You can match it up to the corner of this paper.  Does that make a right angle? You've got one right there.  Once you draw that, help your friend out.  Let's see.  I don't see any shapes, and I see you playing.  I'm going to go to another group and when I come back I hope I see shapes on there.  Let me see.  Good. Nice job.  Keep going.  Which two did you put together to get that?  Student A, less talking, more working.  I'm not worried about what Student Z said.  It looks like this one and another one of those?  Good.  Let's see what else we can find.  Let me see.  Nice.  What can you put with that? What?",0
"I just want to know what you think.You haven’t learned it yet, so I don’t expect you to know a whole lot.And it’s okay if things are wrong.Teacher D and I are going to be looking for groups that are participating.We need everybody getting a chance to talk, okay?",1
"Two out of five.  Excellent, ladies.  You can find a seat. Thank you.  What questions do we have, so far?  What questions do we have, so far?  Is that a hand?  No?  All right.  We’re going to do an activity that has to do with fractions, okay?  So I know that some of you saw these this morning.  You are going to get a carton of eggs.  They’re not real eggs.  They’re plastic ones.",0
"Oh, and I love the way that Student J is excited to do the activity, but he’s not shouting out, okay?",0
"I’m going to ask you to go sit where Student J is sitting. Student J, who is your 6:00 partner?",0
"I’m going to ask you to go sit next to Student J.  Student C, who is your 6:00 partner?",0
"Your 6:00 partner is Student S.  I’m going to ask you and Student S to go sit at the horseshoe table.  Can I hand - that’s four at this group, so could I have you take this? Bring your pencil with you. Be very careful of the camera. Student A – oh, and I love that some people are waiting so patiently.  I love it.  Student A, what’s your 6:00 partner?",0
"Student J, I’m going to come ask you to sit where Student K is sitting.  Student K, who is your 6:00 partner?",0
"Student K, I’m going to go ask you to sit where Student P is sitting.  Student P, who is your 6:00 partner?",0
"Student D, I’m going to just have the three of you work as a group, right there, is that okay?  Excellent.  I will give you yours.",0
"Yes, you may open it.  All right, so you can sort of open it. See what they feel like.  People’s look a little bit different.  Okay.  Boys and girls, I just want to make one thing very clear before we begin.  Can I have your attention for just a minute, please?  Thank you.  The color of the eggs does not matter, okay?  Student K, what did I just say, sweetheart?",0
"There’s 12, okay?  There’s 12 eggs in the carton.  What I would like you to do now is to put your name on your paper if you haven’t already, okay?  Student C, what do you need sweetheart?  A pencil?  Be very careful of the camera, okay?  All right.  If you can hear my voice, please put your hands on your head.  If you can hear my voice, please look at me. All right.  We’re going to be pretending, pretending, of course.  They’re not real eggs.  We’re going to pretend that we’re baking a cake, okay?  And I’m going to say you need six eggs to bake that cake, so I want each partners – or there’s a group of three over there – to remove six eggs from the carton.  Wait.  It doesn’t matter which six you take out.  Keep that in mind.  Any six eggs you may take out.  Do that, now.  And if they start rolling you can put them in the colored bins.",0
"Yeah, you can put them in there just to hold them if they’re rolling everywhere.Please take out six.All right.Once you’ve done that, please put your hands on your shoulders so that I know that you’re ready.Student D, that’s not a good place for them, okay, sweetheart?",1
"Do not bring your pencil.Your paper.Any of the eggs.You’re just going to take a look at the different ways that people took out those six eggs, okay?You only have 30 seconds to do this.Of course, Student J, there’s no running.There’s absolutely no talking.",0
"Not running.  Can you talk, Student D?  No.  All right.  So I would like you to please push in your chairs.  Stand up. Don’t move, yet.  Just push in your chairs.  Stand up. Push in your chairs.  Don’t [inaudible] yet.  The challenge is, let’s see if we can do this without turning on our voice.  You’re looking at the different ways that people arranged their eggs.  Go ahead.  Thirty seconds starts now. Oh, my goodness.  I’m going to have a whole lot of points to give out.",0
"Here’s my question.  How is it that they took out the same fraction of eggs, but yet these two containers look so different?  Student D, I don’t want you playing with the eggs, sweetheart, because that means you’re not learning. Why don’t you put those back, right in the bin?  I’m super confused.  I need some help.  Somebody help me out. Somebody help me out.  Student D, what are you thinking? Student C, don’t [inaudible]",1
"Twelve.  They both have six-twelfths left.  That’s really important to remember with fractions, because as long as they’re – was it Student E that talked about the equal parts?  Who talked about the equal parts?  Student A? Student D?  As long as they’re equal sizes, and we have these equal sized pieces, okay?  So in this case, the eggs it doesn’t matter which order we take them in, or which order we take them from.  All that matters is how many there are and how many that’s left.  So if there’s six out of twelve, even if they’re arranged differently, if this group still has six out of the twelve left, the fraction is the same. Ask questions.  What are we confused about?  I know that’s sort of a lot to take in.  Is anybody?  Be honest.  Who’s stuck and sort of confused as to how those fractions are the same?  Nobody?  All right.  Let’s try one more.  Please put all of your eggs back into the carton.  Make sure both partners get a chance to do some.  Okay.  And I want you to read number two.  I didn’t have you shade in number one on the page, because we did that together, but now we’re going to do number two.  Could someone read it for me?  In a nice, loud reading voice?  Student S, could you read number two for me, please?  Start with –",1
"Okay, that’s fine.  That’s fine.  As long as I know that. Student L, finish yours.  All right.  Student K, perfect. All right, if you can hear my voice, put your hands on your head.  Student K, if you can hear my voice, put your hands on your head.  All right, if you can hear my voice, please look at me.  The question asks what fraction of the entire set is four?  First of all, does everybody have four eggs left?",0
"All right.  Let’s stop.  I want everyone to put their eggs down, if you’re playing with them.  I think we’re getting confused.  And look at me.  It’s the same thing as with the students.  It’s asking what fraction of the eggs that is four – think about what the top number is, Student J.  The top number is how many eggs we have left.  Student D, what’s the top number of my fraction?  The numerator?",1
"Eight-twelfths.  How’d you get that, Student J?  And I’m going to call on people to make sure that they’re listening, because Student J, I know is going to have a really great idea.  How’d you get that, Student J?",1
"He removed eight out of the twelve, so for B his answer looked like this.  [Teacher writing on board].  And I just have to say right now - Student S, go put a point in for great listening.  You’re not playing with the eggs.  You’re not making jokes with the people around you.  You’re ready to learn.  I bet you’re going to do awesome with fractions.  I don’t expect everybody to completely understand them, today, but I do expect that you’ve learned something, and that’s only possible if you were listening.  B.  Eight out of twelve.  Student J, tell me what Student J just said. How did he get eight out of twelve?",1
"Not right this second.  All right.  I know that it just got a little bit loud across the [inaudible], but I really appreciate the people who are still listening.  If you can hear my voice, clap once.  [Clapping].  If you can hear my voice, clap twice.  [Clapping].  If you can hear my voice, put your hands on my head.  If you can hear my voice, put your hands on your shoulders.  If you can hear my voice, take your hands off my shoulders. I’m wondering – this is a super-de-duper big challenge, so it’s okay if we don’t get it yet.  But did any groups, Student C, listening.  I might call on you to repeat some ideas.  Does any group have sort of, maybe an idea of a fraction that is the same as four-twelfths.  Noticing the way I divided the groups.  Student J, what are you thinking?",0
"I’m going to write your idea like this.  One-half equals six- twelfths.  Is that all right?  Okay.  What else do we know about fractions?  I’m going to come to someone from the red group after Student J, so be thinking.  Maybe you’re just going to take - Student C, I might call on you, sweetheart. You better put that ruler away.  Look at me.  Put the ruler away.  You need to be thinking.  Maybe you’re going to take an idea from here – that’s fine – and put it over here.  It doesn’t have to be a brand new idea, but you should be thinking.  Student J, what else do we know about fractions?",1
"When you’re done, raise your hand.  Boys and girls, you’re doing this on your own, so that I can see who needs some extra help.  There’s no talking.  It’s not hard.  What fraction is six?  I can’t tell you.  Go ahead, Student J, A, B, and C.  Why do I hear your voice, Student D?  You don’t need your voice to write.  It’s very important that you do this on your own, unless you’re working with Teacher D.",1
"Stop.  Can you help Student J?  Just color in the eggs and then have him do the paper on his own?  All right.  I’m coming to collect them.  You should have had enough time.  I have to say I would like Student D, Student E, and Student D to go put a point in for responsibility for their team. There was no chatting, over there.  And I see some different answers on their paper.  Different work done, so I know that they worked independently.  Student J, can I have yours?  When I collect your paper, you can put the eggs together.  [Inaudible]?  [Inaudible] are you almost done?  All right.  Here’s your ticket.  Why don’t you have an answer, sweetheart?",1
"Yellow group.  You may go.  Be very careful of the camera. Horseshoe table, you may go.  Green group, you may go. Student G, be very careful of the camera.  You just walked way too quickly  near it.  Boys and girls, let’s problem solve.  Instead of making a line in front of the camera, can we please line up this way?  Away from the camera, please.  Red group, to the stop sign without turning on your voice.",1
"Hmm.  Need some help?  All right.  Make sure you’re listening. Hmm.  Who can tell me sort of, what Student D was just talking about?  Not word for word.  I should see more hands.  It doesn’t have to be exactly what she said. Student J, what was she sort of, just talking about? Because she had a really great idea.  I just want to make sure that everybody knows it.",1
"Come up and write it for me, so I can see.  Student D, Student C, can you scoot over this way a little bit so the camera can see the board?  Yeah, you can stand in front of this board.  That’s fine.  Yeah, right up here.  [Inaudible] so they can see.  Thank you, Student C.  Student P, how did you get that?",1
"Four people.  Do you know what the fraction might be?  Let’s take a look.  Student D, and Student C, can you split up for just a minute?  Student P told me that one out of five, one-fifth are wearing a purple-striped shirt.  If I said what fraction of them are not?  You told me there’s one, two, three, four that are not, out of how many?",0
I can’t hear you.  What did you say?  Speak up.,0
"Two-dimensional, right.  That’s for that.  But when we’re dealing with cubes, we have three different numbers; it becomes a cube.  When we’re dealing with two number then it’s what?  Squared.  I’ll hold on because I’ve got something people who are not focused.  They’re not paying attention.  I also want you to look around your areas for one second please.  Now what I’m gonna ask you to do is I’m gonna ask you to draw a box and we’re gonna practice together.",1
"960 cubic inches inside.  Excuse me.  Can we focus?  Student T, I’m over here.  Turn around.  And it’s a very simple formula.  The formula is not complicated.  If we’re looking for the volume inside, what we want to do is make sure you know your volume.  How deep?  How much room?  And that was the main thing it told me, how much room is inside this box.  Yes?",1
"There’s no magic to it.  If you want to find the volume, all you’re doing is looking at the length, width and height. I’ll wait because there are some people being rude, people up walking around.  I’ll wait for you.  Pencils.  And I’ll wait for Student J, who is not on point either.  Student J, no, you are being rude right now.",0
"Sweetie, this is not the time.",0
I’ll wait for you because you’re being rude.  You all are making me feel quite disrespected right now.  [Inaudible].,1
"Hi.  Could you pick that up please?  Have a seat please.  Now this is for you.  I need you to understand.  I’m trying to get you to understand how to do this, so you won’t have an issue with it.  Do we understand that?  You don’t need to have these and I don't know why you have them, so put them back.  We’re working with the box.  Could you get these out of your chair?  We were just working with the box.  Did you have a good meeting?",1
Repeat yourself.  I can’t understand what you just said.,1
Raise your hands.  Don’t yell it out.  We got some people that said they got an answer.,1
"I’ll wait.  I’ll wait.  I know you’re excited.  It’s 3,500 cubic yards but it could also be read, like Student K said, 3,500 cubic yards, but he said yards to the third power or yards cubed.  Do you want to do another one?",0
"Excuse me, Student J.  We raise hands.  Why wouldn’t we put a video game in here?  Student J.",0
"Okay.  Raise your hand.  What do you have, Student G?",0
Okay.  I can’t hear her.  Why are you doing 10 times 18?,0
So should you – I’ll wait because you all are being very rude. You’re being really rude.,1
"You can fix it.  Okay.  You know what?  I love you ideally, but you guys have been really rude.",1
"Student S, sit up please.  Thank you.  Yes.  What’s missing?",0
"You’re gonna exit to out the door in a minute.  That’s where you’re gonna exit to.  It’s only 2:15, yes.  We’re gonna exit into something else because we’ll move over and start doing something else.  You ready?",1
"Everybody got their box ready?  I’ll wait for you, Student J. Student J.",0
Let’s get it together.,0
Are you ready?,0
"Wait a minute.  I can’t hear you all.  Student D.  I’ll wait. So the box had to be at least that big, right, to fit that amount.  Very good.",1
"Go ahead and get out all your math materials please, your math",0
"Yeah, square units.  You're measuring going down here, okay? Student J's side, you may take a bathroom and water break. I'm going to count this one right here, going down. Student A, no sir, not until I get some work done.  Then you can go.",1
"So again, you guys are not paying attention.  The base is 14 and the height is 5.  14 times 5 is 70.  What are you missing from this part?",0
"Yes.  What's your question?  Make sure you fix that.  Second step is you're plugging in all the numbers.  You haven't done it correctly.  Erase.  Stay focused back there.  Erase everything, all this underneath.  Okay.  What numbers do we know?",0
"Do B times 25.  Next row is going to be 800 divided by 25.  Do that work right here, and you're going to do B equals whatever it is.  Student J.  If you get done early – it doesn't look like you've done anything since I've looked at your paper.  What number are you on?",0
"I'm going to walk around and take a look.Do it on a separate sheet of paper.Make sure you show all your steps like we just now did in class on the board.Student A, you need to get into the habit of sharpening your pencil every morning.I'm going to sharpen one more for you.",0
"I'm coming around to take a look at your work, boys and girls.I don't understand why all your problems are having [inaudible].It's not working.You have three.That should be enough.Sit up nice and straight.Don't forget to put parenthesis around that.",0
"I don't know what you're working on in class because you're not doing class work.  You're not doing homework.  Now you're sleeping in class.  If you're not doing your homework, you must be sleeping at home.  Who else did I not see homework from?  Everyone else I saw?  Okay.  Go ahead and open up your page to 442 for review for me, please.  All right. When I call your name to the board, you need to show me all the steps.  Student J, go ahead and do number eight.  Do it on this side of the board, and number 10, Student C is going to do it on that side.  You should all be watching, pencils away, red pens out only.  Student J, that was homework, not class work.  Red pens out.  Nice and big so everybody can see it.  Erase and start over.  Start with what?  The formula.  Red pens.  Student A, do you have a red pen out?  Didn't I just give you one the other day? Why is it that I keep skipping over you magically every time?  You need to get it together.  Do you have your red pen out?  All right.  Let's go ahead and start with number eight here.  Start with your formula.  A equals a half times base times height.  The second step is A equals a half times the base which is what?  What is the base?",0
"It should be 8 times H now.  You can take away the parenthesis now.  You're done with the parenthesis.  Missing what here? 8 times H.  What's the opposite of multiplying?  Now you're dividing and you're going to be able to figure out what H is.  My two helpers, Student R and Student B, could you go around and pick up last night's homework for me, please?  What is the base?",0
"That should be 8 times H.  Do I have everyone's homework from last night?  Who is saying no?  Student J, is that you? Are you being silly?  Here's 8 times H.  Now what is the opposite of multiplying?",0
"Done?  All right.  I'm about to do it on the board.  You haven't even done number one.  You haven't solved anything. You haven't even copied the problem down off the board. Everyone's almost done.  All right.  I need all eyes on the board.  Pencils down, all eyes on the board for me, please. All right.  Number one, we don't have a triangle there for us, but I've given you all the information you need.  You start out by what?  What's our first step?  Write the formula.  A equals half times base times height.  Okay. Don't tell me B times H, okay?  I need you to tell me what it is so we know what that word means.  The next step, we're plugging in the numbers.  We don't know what A is.  A stays the same.  Half stays the same.  Do we know what our base is?",0
"It's not square.  Base and height is not squared.  It's squared only as the area.  Now I'm going to have you practice for a grade.  We've gone over our homework, practiced some more, and the more you practice, the better you're going to get. Anybody have any questions before I give you your class work?  Okay.  I asked you all to keep your workbooks because we're going to be working on workbook page 108.  Go ahead and turn there.  I'll be calling areas for bathroom and water break.  On page 108 I want you to go ahead and do just 1-11.  I want you to show me all your work on a separate sheet of paper.  I want it numbered.  There's not enough space on your workbook page to show all your steps, especially starting with number three.  So I need you all to just start with number one on a notebook sheet of paper and show me all your work, and your answer should be the only thing on the lines inside your workbook.  We're doing 1-11.  Any questions?  I need all notebook sheets of paper out so I know you're starting to work.  If you have any questions, come and ask me.  I'm going to sit up here in the front real quick.  I will walk around in a few minutes. I'm just going to glance over your homework.  Yes, dear?",1
"Guys, I can't hear Student E.  So you need to be a little louder, and you need to whisper a little less.",1
"They're there to actually push around and show your math problems, all right?Let's see.All right.I think we're good with adding and subtracting like fractions.So what I'm going to do is invite you to go to centers, and you may take your candy with you, or you may leave it in your bag.",0
"So enjoy your candy, go to your math centers, and I'm going to be pulling some people up to the front to talk about equivalent fractions.Since I won't be using the group table today, that's a place you can use for centers instead of this front floor space.",1
"Student M, you're going to come to me for group, and Student L.  You all can just drop your stuff off, and we're going to be standing at the board.Put your stuff down.We're just going to stand at the board.",1
And you're all for crammed in this tiny little space?  Go where you have room.  You're going to need paper to make your answer sheets.  Okay.  How's it going?  You struggling with anything?  Okay.  Let me know.  Okay.  We actually – can you divide by 3?,1
"3. so we've got 3 and something.  3 times something is going to give me 111.  I see lots of people working it out on the floor.  You can do either 111 divided by 3, or 3 times a mystery number equals 111.  Whatever you want to do.  Can you tell mom that she can't come in right now?  Anybody? If that helps – got it?",0
Very good.  So write down your hundreds.  How far is it from 320 to – can you say it out loud so they can hear it?,0
"What are you wrapping in?  315 plus what?  That should equal what?  You're looking for it to be 634.  I need Student J. Student J will now be leaving the room.  Come sit back here, please.  Get your book and sit back there.  1, 2, 3, eyes on me.  It's too bad that most of you are doing a great job and some of you just want to make a joke of everything.  Student J, go get your things and sit back there.  I'm waiting for you, Student A, to sit down.  The question was, Jamie's family was going to visit their grandmother who lives 634 miles away from their house.  On the first day they drove 319 miles.  How many did they go on the second day?  I'm going to erase this now because everybody remembers RUUSSC right?",0
"You must take 9 away from the 4, like that.I need you to start banging out here.I'm doing a video.You need to go to Ms. H's room now.Take your work to Ms. H's room.All right, everybody.We're going to start to share this.I want to have you stand up here.",0
"I'll have to you sit down, Student M.  I want to explain to us what she did, and I'm going to write it over here if we think this is a good way to do it.",1
"Let Student A answer, please.",0
"How much is 14 minus 9?  Please don't yell out.  5.  Let's cut this down to just two tens.  She had one 10 she needed to take away, Student E.",0
Listen to me.  Don't look at that.  I have two.  I give you one.  How many do I end up with?,0
I can't hear your voice.  You need to say it much louder.,1
How did you figure that out?  I'm waiting for everyone's eyes and pencils to be down.,0
"I need only the person I'm speaking to, to answer, please.  4. Then we turn this into an 8, 800, and 8 minus 0 – how do I double check my work using the American algorithm, Student J?",0
"Everybody close your eyes, please.  This is what I was hoping you would do to begin with.  This is what you need to do when you're doing a story problem.  So Student C, if your eyes are closed, and you're imagining, I have to go to my grandmother's.  It's way over there, 634 miles away.  It's too far for me to drive in one day, Student J.  Today I'm going to go 319 miles.  Tomorrow I'm going to go some more to get there, because I'm not there yet.  319.  Is that bigger than 634?  No.  It's smaller.  So don't I need to go more tomorrow to get there?  Yes.  If I go 319 today, am I going to add miles on tomorrow, or go backwards towards home?  I want to get to my grandmother's house.  Do I go 319 miles today and turn around and go back?",1
"And Student J, how far of a jump is that?  Plus 80.  I'm going to wait until Student A shows me his complete attention. Student V, what's my next jump from there?",0
"You can work with Student A.  I don't know why you're up there, but you need to take it up there.  You need to be very quiet.  Student V, can you work with Student L up here? Yes?",0
"No, 10 plus 5.  I need big voices for this, everybody.",0
"No.  That is not your answer.  Be careful.  1, 2, 3, eyes on me.  I want to share very quickly.  On the count of three I would like you in your seats, please.  1, 2, 3.  All right, everybody.  Number two – I know we're running late. I'm sorry.  I'm going to wait until I hear all the voices stop, and I see everybody paying attention and not drawing on their desk.  Mr. Rivera and Ms. Santos each drove from Boston to two different cities.  Mr. Rivera drove 446 miles to Washington.  Ms. Santos drove 1,300 to Orlando.  How many more miles did Ms. Santos drive?  You're visualizing. The first thing you're doing is closing your eyes.  You're saying, ""Mr. Rivera drove 446 miles.""  Which one is further?  Is 1,300 further or 446?",1
"Because that's how far one person drove.  Now I want to know what the difference is that gets me to what ending?  What's the furthest?  1,300. Student J, could you stop, please? Okay.  I'm waiting for all eyes.  Pencils are down and all eyes.  So if I'm doing a number line, who could help me do the number line?  Student C, 446 to what?  What's the first thing I'm going to jump to?",0
"Student A?  Student L, you're going to be next.  Be prepared. You need to pay attention.  Student C, what we did is finding the difference.",1
"R is read it, understand, and underline, show it, solve it, check it.  Okay.  I forgot to check it.  I didn't check. Okay.  Read it, understand it, underline it, show it, solve it, and check it.  So we read it.  I think it's a good idea to read it again, right?  Now we have to underline.  So Jamie's family visited their grandmother who lives 634 miles from their house.  On the first day they drove 319 miles.  How many miles did they have left to drive on the second day?  What am I going to underline?  What's important here, Student M?  Can I have you sitting up, Student J?  I know yesterday was a long day, but we need to pay attention.",1
"Very good.  Why don't you go around as mentor?  Don't give them the answer.  Remember, you're just helping them.  So show me what you would write there.  So Student J, you ended up with an answer of 953.  Tell me what you did.  What was your thinking?",1
"Okay, because you know that’s a partial quotient, right.  Put your hand down, she’s not done.",1
"Yeah, that’s partial, that’s fine.  I don’t want to belabor the same points.  We should be on the next page, and I’m going to make a copy of this.  Excuse me, sit down.  What was your job?",0
"Put that away.  Put that away.  All right, so it says – go ahead, Student A.",0
"What’s the answer?  No, put that away.  No.",0
"What do you want?  Quickly, we’re waiting for you.  You should have been doing that when I asked for people to have their homework out.  So far we’ve wasted about five minutes, to therefore you’ll be sitting here for five minutes doing extra work for me.  Do I have everybody’s attention?  You dropped something, Student L. I will also check off your homework when we’re done.  I want to go over the math packets first.  I graded them, but I still would like to go over them.  So, Student D, come up here. Student A, come up here.  Student H, come up here.  Student A, come up here.  Student A, come up here.  Actually, just hand this to Student A.  Somebody has no name, I don’t know whose it is.  Student L?  Student V?  Student M?  The only thing outside of your homework is your Daily Fix It, your homework, and this packet, everything else goes away, including that.",1
"I’m going to show it to you.  You’re calling out.  All right, so how many animals are there, Student V?",0
"Three flowers.  How many hearts?  Student A, sit down.",0
"Stop calling out, Student C.  Move your clip for calling out. 3 x 3 is 9 x 2 is 18.  You could have done it that way too.  There are 3 groups of animals, 3 groups of flowers, and 2 groups of hearts.  That way you could do it too.  So either way. If you’re not sure you’re comfortable with when to multiply, then you write the out, but what’s the most important thing you’re doing?  What’s the most important thing?",1
"Go sit down.  Week two is not the greatest one.  So which number is the greatest one?  Student C, you’re still doing it.",0
You read it wrong?  Sssh.,0
"14, carry the 1.  $5.49.  The first answer was you should have had on your paper, you should have had $1.25 plus $1.25 plus $2.99 is equal to $5.49.  The more exact that you are, the more information that you show, the more of a better grade you’ll get.  Student C, sit up.",0
"So what do we notice about this chart?  First just looking at the chart, what do you notice?  Wait a second, we’re having technical difficulties right now.  All right, this isn’t the best copy of this one, but you have it right in front of you, right?  Student N, your eyes should be up here. It says Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday – it says number of balls made in the first week.  Let’s just take a look at that first week.  That first number is what?",0
"5, 10, 18, 28.  2, 4, 13, 14, 15.  First of all, 15 and 9 is 24, carry a 2, to start.  That’s why you got over the amount. Let me see.  Go sit down.  You added wrong too.  It was not $9.98. Did you see what you did with this?  So what threw you off was all this stuff.  And I don’t know how you got $9.98 in the first place.  That doesn’t even add up to $9.98.  And this would be over 10.  You [inaudible] subtraction [inaudible].  All right.  Yes?",0
"Why don’t you come sit over here, just for this thing.",0
"No.  All right, next one.  I’ll wait, I’ll wait.  Okay.  More time that you owe me if you keep talking.  Who has a question?",0
"I’m going to move your seat somewhere, I don’t know where. First, Student K read it.",0
"Oh, because you wrote 3:52, this part was wrong.  That should have wrong.  This is wrong if you got this wrong, because it’s really 9:15.  So this one’s right, but these two are wrong, so just pay attention. So if we are adding 30 minutes to 9:15, what time is, Student L? Come up here and do it.  See that?  You could have put a [inaudible], you could them completely right.  Can you sit in so nobody trips over you?  You could have done it too.",1
"Put that money away.  You could have put it on the board too, you got it right.",0
"I didn't look at yours yet.   You could have put it on the board.  Scootch in.  Are you going to be playing with those all day?  Excuse me, Student M, do we have this conversation every day?  Put it away.  Every day. Let me see, did you get this one right?",0
"Shhhhhhh! This is right.  Put it away.  All right, so…",0
"No, you’re calling out again.  Sit the right way. So, 30 minutes…",1
"Okay, go ahead.  Student K, move your clip, you’re not paying attention.  You were fooling.  Student M, did you put it away?  Yes, Student C?",1
"You can’t do that because you had to have known that it [inaudible].  That doesn’t answer the question.  Go ahead. Same thing.  Sit down.  Yours is wrong.  All right, next. Just erase that, you had 9:85.  There’s no such thing as 9:85.",1
"It’s the same thing.  She added the minutes, only she did it on a number line.  All right.  5, 4, 3, 2.  You know what guys?  When we do these math problems we’re going to have to sit – girls – we’re going to have to sit longer. Student D, in your seat on your bottom.  Same thing goes with you, Student C.  So the next thing, the pencil one, Student A, can you read the first line, just the first line?  Not even on the right page.",0
You’re also calling out.  Sit down.  This one’s wrong.,0
"Right, a rectangle and a triangle.  All right put these away, you can take these home.",0
"I want her to see it though.  All right, you know what, put your homework away, we’re going to go over that in about 15 minutes.",1
"Sshh, okay, we’re only going to do one more page of these, only one more, then we’re going to go over the homework, all right?  One more page double-sided.  Yes, Student D? Student C, come up here and get this for your group.  Just one page, one side.",0
"[Inaudible] right now.  [Inaudible] and go sit down.  Student K come up here and get this for your grow.  Student S come up here.  You’re only doing one this time.  Student A.  You have four people.  Quietly please.  Sssshhh! Okay, put your name on these.  Put your name on it.  Student C, come on. You should have it passed out by now.",0
"Okay, there’s another one on my desk.  Student D has one. That’s all, just one.  Go ahead, work on it now quietly. Can I have my pencils back, my marker back?  Sharpener.  If you’re talking you’re in… If you’re talking you’re in.",0
"Go.  Ssssh! Sssssh! Student K, sit down.  I always spell your last name wrong.",0
"You’re doing the problems by yourself, you’re putting your name on it.  Focus, please.  You can explain it.  Sssshhh! Is this right?",1
"No, no, no, no, no.   Ssssshh! Sssssh! Underline important information.  Good math students always get rid of the parts that don’t make sense.",0
"Okay, eyes up here.",0
You should see you when you’re doing that.  You look silly when you’re doing that.  The camera’s right on you.  You look silly. Fewer.  Fewer than 8.  How many books did Marlow read?,0
Go sit down.,0
"Student A, sit down.  Student A, your job today is to not call out and to not get out without being told.",0
I already just guessed.  Can you put your feet in the right way?,0
"So everybody should have gotten that one right, there’s no excuse for that one.  You need to take it slow.  Remember, when you’re doing these Mcast questions, you are going to have the whole day to do them.  Don’t rush.  The first one done is not the winner.  Like I said, my daughter used to take all day, and she got advanced in every single category, because she took her time.  It’s more important to concentrate and take your time.  Student M, stop tapping.",1
"When you’re with me for teacher time, we are going to be practicing doing conversions, and I would like for you to bring just a marker to use on the white board or a pencil and paper.Okay?This table will be teacher first, that table will be partner first.",0
"Yes, you did.  I’m going to give you your board back, thank you, Student R.  And let me get an eraser.  Okay, I’m going to try giving you some and I want you to do them on your own on the white board and show me your answer.  6 cups equals how many pints?  6 cups is how many pints?",0
"All right, go ahead and clear off your boards.  Thank you for your hard work.  Thank you for those problems that you gave me, those were really good, and we’re going to get ready to switch.  Okay, those of you who are at the tables, if you would go ahead and find a stopping point.",1
"If you are finished with your assignment you can turn it in to the turn-in bin.  If you are not, please put it in your binder.  You’ll finish it in that station tomorrow.  My independent friends, you are going to move to partners. Partners coming to me.  My teacher friends, you guys are going to go to independent.",0
"That’s three.  All right, the next thing I want you to realize is when I’m going from a smaller unit to a bigger unit, if I’m going from cups to pints… Can I help you?",0
"Turn-in bin.  If they’re not complete, put them in your binder, and that’s where you’ll pick up tomorrow when you go to this center.  I need everybody to come on back to your assigned seats, take out your agendas.",0
"So yesterday we started on how do we multiply decimals.  So we’re going to start off and we’re going to go over our homework.  What I did was, I got these little packets, so that not only will we make sure that the models that we made on our paper were good, we’re also going to make them in real life, okay?  All righty.  Number one was what?  Do you want to raise your hand?  Go ahead, Student S.",0
"Student N, say it one more time because Student T didn’t hear you.",1
"Say that again, I didn't hear you.",1
"Okay, guys, go ahead and get out your math for today.  Let's go over math for today.  [Inaudible] on Tuesday.  Go ahead and stand up.  [Inaudible] math for today.  We'll just look at it. Okay, looking at the first one, Student F, why isn't yours out? Okay, looking at the first one, do ya'll have the transparency today?  The first one says – well, actually, Student C, tell me what the first one says.",0
"Okay, more and more.  I'm sorry.  Why are you up, Student A?",0
"Good.  That means now you'll know.  Make sure you're copying it down.  As you're copying it down or as some of you are finishing it, I want you to look at my circle.  I have labeled my circle with some points and some line segments, okay.  In a second we're gonna talk and we're gonna try to figure out which line segment equals the radius, which line segment equals the diameter, and which line segment equals a cord.  So as you're finishing, go ahead and start looking at that.",1
"So what does that mean?  They need to have a stopping point, right.  And what are those two stopping point?  Points, simply put, okay.  Those of you who just came from [inaudible], you can do the same activity.  I don't have enough circles, but you can do the same activity with, like, draw a circle on a sheet of paper.  You can do it in a group as well.  Do two groups, okay.",0
"Two.  Student A, you can work in that group.  I'm sorry, Student A.  I'm wondering why you're at your desk, to get your markers or something.  Okay, great.",0
"You get finished, raise your hands up.",0
"Okay, guys, we're about to stop.  I want everybody to stop. Keep thinking if you haven't gotten yet.  [Inaudible]",0
"Okay.  I'm gonna let this group go just because they were the first group to tell me.  Now you guys go.  You need to hold your circle up and tell me.  Everybody's attention should be here.  What we were trying to figure out – stand it up – what we were trying to figure is – come right here – I told you to the formula for circumference is pi times diameter, right.  Pi almost equals to what, guys?  3.14, right, and for some reason we have that number.  Who gave pi that number? So what you guys are trying to figure out is if you have the diameter of your circle, what's the relationship between the diameter and pi, which will help explain why the formula is 3.14 for pi times diameter.  Stop it.  Let's go.",1
"Okay.  You need to be in your seats by the count of five, one, two.  Student F and Student B, that's your recess.  Thank you.",0
"No.  Okay, I think it's Student F.  Okay, my review questions and we're wrapping up the lesson.  Who is this?  I am a closed figure that has no beginning and no end point. Raise your hand.  Who is this, Student I?",0
"Can I see please?  Now, I want you to round it to the nearest whole number.  I added something in there.  So now I want you to add to the nearest whole number and since we have a few students in here, why don’t come up a little closer, row two?  You're fine.  Okay.  You're fine.  And then row 3, you can move up.  Student D, move back a little bit, okay, because I think Student A is going to come in late.",1
"[Inaudible] but what does it mean when I say a fraction?  I want you to think, if I had—oh, did you know that that says one half.  What does that mean?  And you say, oh I have a fraction, Mrs. W.  What does that mean?  Wait, hold on before you answer, Student W.  We want to make sure everyone’s listening first.  What does it mean when you talk about the word fraction?  All right, Student A, what do you think?",1
"Because you know when we grade our papers and our homework, you guys tend to write the wrong numbers on numerator and denominator.  So I want to know what the numerator means and the denominator.  I love the way you're raising your hand.  Student S?",0
Use your words.,0
"All right, one, two, three, eyes on me.",0
"Mrs. A, why don’t we go back to our seat because it seems like we’re not really listening.  Three.  What are we doing at our seat?  Student F, what are we doing?",1
"Don’t worry about that right now.  Student N, you need—here’s a seat right here or you want to pull a chair up there so you can sit instead of—here you go.  Once you put it together, you may talk about it in your group and see if you can come up with some things you notice are similar with each other.",1
"All right, freeze.  If you didn’t finish putting it together, it’s fine.  I want you to look.  Leave the pieces to the side.  Now I want you to focus on those fraction emphasis. Look at the numbers, maybe the size of them.  Think about equivalents.  Okay?  And see if you can come up with some ideas to what you notice or if there's a pattern or something.  Can you see it sideways?  It’s okay, you don’t have to—why don’t you sit here, okay?",1
"All right, there's five people but I hear two people talking at one time.  So who’s talking?",0
"Hold on, let Student finish talking.",0
"Are you up?  I can’t tell.  Okay.  He said 35, he said buzz.",0
"We’ve talked about them separately, but we need to talk about them together so we can clear up your confusions and see how they are alike and how they’re different.Student M, it’s not going to be up here all day, so you need to pick up your pencil and write.",1
"Okay.  Next time you need to remember to bring it here, because you’re gonna need to re-copy that in your notebook.  [Long pause]  Okay, while you’re doing that, I’m going to get 18 counters so we can see what three times six actually looks like. And when you’re finished copying that definition, please put your notebook on your desk with the pencil in it and smile sweetly at me.  Okay, Student A, we’re copying this definition down in our math practice workbook.  Okay, when you’re finished, put the pencil in the notebook, close the notebook and smile sweetly.  Thank you.  Thank you, Student M.  Yes, ma’am?",1
"If it doesn’t matter which order the factors are in, we call that the what?  Get Student M to whisper it in your ear if she knows it.",0
We did – we talked about that while you were sleeping.  Student J?,0
"Okay.  So let me see.  Student J’s group, your target number is – please stop.  Your target number is 20.  Okay, write it down on your dry erase board if you need to remember it. Your target number is 30.  Your target number – somebody write it down – is 24.  Okay.  Your target number, let’s see, [Inaudible] 36.  Okay.  Your target number is, hmm, hmm, your target number – let’s see.  Your target number is 32, okay?  All right.",0
"Okay, what does that say to you?  If you had to write an expression, what would you say?  How many rows do you have and how many are in that row?  One times 20, okay?  And stand it up like a tower.  Then you have 20 times one. Okay, freeze.  Sit right where you are.  Don’t erase anything on your board and – and let’s talk about your findings.  And nobody reaches back into a tub.  Have a seat.  Okay, we’re gonna go to each table and talk about each number, and you’re gonna – you – in making the arrays – put your hands on top of your head, please.  Student M, Student M, I’m waiting.  In making the arrays, you found the factors of your target number, so that’s what you’re gonna tell me.  You can take your hands off, but I want you to have a marker in your hand and be ready to write on your dry erase board.  You found the factors of your target number by doing this.  Student J’s group, your target number was what, Student K?",1
"One and 32.  All right, please look at the board and let me ask you a question.  I don’t have people looking at the board yet.  I’m waiting.  We found a lot of factors, but I’m not sure if we can be sure that we found them all.  You just called them out to me and I wrote them on the board any old way.  So they’re not in any particular order, except that’s how you told them to me.  So can you be absolutely sure that you have all of the factors of your target number?",0
"Okay, I’m not sure that we can.  We might have missed something doing it this way.  Everything that you gave me up there is true, but we just can’t be sure when we have no organization that we have them all.  So would you like to know a way that you can be sure that you find all of the factors of a number?  So I think – I would love to.  So I’m – let’s see, Student J, would you erase this quickly, please, and you erase your dry erase board.  Put all of your manipulatives back in the bag, and we’re gonna find – we’re gonna practice a way that you can be absolutely positive you have all of the factors.  Okay.  All right, Student L is gonna get Kleenex for erasers.  Thank you for doing that.  Okay.",1
"Okay.  All right, if you would stand still, I would appreciate it.  Tuesday.  So we’re gonna start with Student A.",0
"Okay, but can you tell me about that when math is over?  And I do want to hear it.  Is that happening today?",1
"So we can blame Teacher.  Okay.  So we’re gonna use height, okay, because why?  Let’s kind of go back a couple of weeks to what we did initially.  What do we – what can we do with this little part if we move it over here?  And my people, have a good day that are going to violin.  That’s what we’re – you’re leaving now, okay, and we’ll see you later when you come back.  If you take this part, Student V, what can we do to that part?  Do we want to just get rid of it, or what can we do to it?  Tape it.  So – and then we’re gonna – if we do that over here, what have we got?  Anybody want to help her out?  How did we figure that out?  Let’s take a look at –",0
I think you can wait until later.  You’re okay.,0
"It’s right in here.  That’s what I told you.  You can do it study hall.  Okay, go ahead.",0
"Student S, is that what you’re supposed to be doing?",0
Just go ahead and get on it anyway and see if you can play by yourself.,0
"Student A, what are you supposed to be doing?  What?",0
"It just picks it up.  You don’t have to speak into it.  Okay, is that where you’re supposed to be sitting?",0
"Ma’am, go ahead and go where you need to be.",0
Watch out where you’re stepping.  Are you gonna – the game? Are you supposed to be playing Hit the Target?,0
"Girls, go ahead and take two separate chairs, please.  Don’t – not on the rolling chair.  Thank you.",0
"Okay, Student E, why don’t you come over and sit with – Student E, why don’t you come on over and sit with Student A and Student S, so that way you’re not by yourself.",1
"Student J, let’s come with me, please.  Thank you.  And you need to grab a chair from a table nearby, that is fine. Student S, gently.  Thank you.  Okay, what we’re gonna do is take a look, and you’re each gonna take a piece of paper, and we’re gonna make compound figures, and we’re gonna do it out of these shapes.  But you’re going to determine the area of the shape and then you’re gonna glue it down as a compound figure.  And actually, I’m gonna make this one smaller for you because it will be too hard. Actually, let’s see if we can – some of you will have triangles to deal with and some of you will not.  And let’s see – we might have to use two different colors, and that’s okay.",1
"Student S, put that down, please, and get your work done. Thank you.",0
"No, it really – it’s the same, isn’t it?  So either way, as long as you know that it’s not this, then you’re okay, okay?  Guys, be careful with that, please.  Make sure you’re doing the right thing.",0
"They can hear everything we’re saying, but that’s not for you to worry about.  Actually, you need to be –",0
"Okay.  And so what would your total area be for that rectangle? Student V, you can have a lot of work to do today.",0
"Good job.  You already got some water and we’re gonna be switching very soon, so you can wait.",1
"Student J, I want you to run over there – not run, walk – walk over there and take a look at the poster so you can remember what base times height is, okay?",1
"Okay, if you would go ahead and clean up, you’re gonna have a journal topic.  If you are doing Super Source, take the journal topic with you back to your desk, and if you get started right away, I’ll be giving out tickets.  Okay, what is that?",0
"Go back to your seat.  All right, I like that Student A has his journal open right away and he’s getting started on his journal topic.  If you do not have a journal topic with you, I will put one on the board – that is not your seat. Thank you.  That is my seat.  Thank you.  Thank you.",1
I thought they were.  Oh.  Go sit down and get your journal.,0
"Student N, open your journal and get started.  Get started writing in your journal.  You have it open?  Go ahead and do it.  You can wait two minutes until we’re – Student D.",0
"They’re right on the board.  Journal topics are right on the board.  [Long pause] Keep going, you’re good.  You can sharpen that one if you like.  Have a seat.  [Long pause]",0
"Okay.  All right, it is time to leave.  Make sure that you have your homework out to give to me as you’re going out the door over there.",0
"Okay, write that down, since you don’t have your glasses, and what – now, what you just said.  What did you just say?",1
I asked to use crayons.  You have crayons out.,0
"How are you guys doing?  Okay, but if you are on two different pages, then you’re not working together as a team.  You’ve got three-fourths and four-fifths.",0
I can’t hear you.,0
"One-tenth is greater than one-twelfth.  How come?  Student W, I need you paying attention up here.  Put the pencils down. Why is one-tenth greater than one-twelfth?",0
"So I’m still not sure why one-eighth is greater than one-half. Student W, please sit up.  Okay.  “Hi, yes, it’s Miss B. again.  I’m ordering more pizza.  Mm hmm.  I want two large pizzas.  One of the pizzas I would like for you to cut into two equal pieces.  Okay, two equal pieces, good.  The other pizza I want you to cut into eight equal pieces.  Yep, eight equal pizzas – pieces.  Okay, thank you.”  So I’ve just ordered two pizzas, right?  They’re both large.",0
See this? Going across are your rows.I’m going to give you some little colored tiles for your table.Fill in each row with a different color.We need to stay focused.You need to look at your board and figure out what the division problem is.,0
"Remember, your columns go this way, up and down.  So if you were gonna come up with your division problem you would say 20 total number – so 20 divided by the number of rows that you have  equals the number of columns.  Do you see that? Take your math journal and your math folder out.  I want you to write this down in here.  The total number of squares divided by the rows equals columns.  After you write that in your journal I want you to clear the pieces off your white boards and I want you to clear your white boards. Remember when you’re looking at a division array, instead of total number of squares you divide by your rows – your rows go across – equals the number of what, Student J?",0
"Very good.  Now we’re going to be working with making a model with your division problems.  I need everybody to clear your pieces off your board.  Clear your boards. I need everybody to clear your boards.  On this next one we’re going to be working with making models.  You’re going to take your total and divide them into an equal number of groups. So If I gave you the problem 12 divided by six, how many pieces do you need to take right now?",0
"I want everybody to take 12 pieces. It doesn’t really matter what colors.  If you want to get all the same color that’s fine, but it doesn’t matter.  Once you have 12 pieces, how many groups are you gonna have to have with those 12 pieces?",0
"It’s 20 because this is two tens you had leftover, just like when we modeled it.  We had two tens and now it’s 20 you actually have.  Perfect.  Okay.  If you’ve got two hundreds, are you going to be able to give one to each of those people?  No.  You’re going to have to make that trade and turn it into 20 tens.  Remember doing that before when we made our trades?  Remember, it’s going to be 20, so you cannot make groups of 3 with only 2 of these.  Go back to the model.  You’ve got 2 of these.  How are you going to put these into 3 equal groups?  See if you can trade them out for tens.  All right, my friends.  I know you’ve only gotten a little bit of practice.  I’d like you to stop and just write a sentence about modeling and the algorithm, and how it worked for you.  Just give me one sentence.  I’m going to write my sentence on the board, but don’t steal my thinking, though.  Close with a sentence.  You can start off with something that was good about the model, something that was not good about the model, and write that in your journal. Then you can start making a transition for social studies.  Ms. A’s friends, as soon as you are ready to go, you may.  The materials person at each group should go ahead and return the materials.",0
"So you are going to be working with the person next to you.If there’s no one right next to you and you would like to move to another spot, that’s okay.Student D, if you’d like to move next to Student J, that’s okay.Student E, if you want to move next to Student T, that would be perfect.",0
"Okay.Student D, just move next to her so the three of you will work together.I’m going back to my problem.All right.Student C, you’re up today.Student C has a bag with 612 jelly beans in it.He wishes to share it equally with his five friends.",1
"Show me how you’re going to divide that up for the 6 people so they each get an equal amount of the jelly beans.So we’ve got our 612.I want to see how this is going to be divided up for 6 people.Model this.Student C does have a lot of jelly beans, and I’m glad he’s sharing, but we don’t have anymore.",0
"Show me the 6 people.How are they going to get it?Focus on the model, Student R.  She wants you to break this up.Do you need a scissor?How are you going to break it up?How are you getting more pieces?Are you going to trade?Make sure she gets an equal amount, okay?",0
"Let’s check back and make sure we still have 236 with all this trading.  We’ve got – go ahead and count them up. Make sure you have 236 all together.  Do me a favor. When you get done with all of your trades, make sure you still have 236 at the end.  You’ve got a great start here.  What are you going to do with these now? These are now – this is your group one, group two, three, four.  How are you going to handle these? Come on back together in 3, 2, 1.  Tell me about this problem.  I heard lots of conversations, lots of thinking, lots of strategies.  First tell me why was this one more challenging than the first one. Student C, what do you thinking?",0
"Do we need to work with everybody?  Yes, we do.  Student E, look at me, Student E.  You’re not.  Listen to me. Sometimes you’re going to be partnered with Student L and you’re going to have to be nice to him.",1
So let’s do – we’ll do two things.  We’ll do a T chart for 24. I’ve got a lot of people that are not with me and they might want to help out.  Student T?,0
"I would agree.Thumbs up.I don’t know how many animals there are, so I do not know yet what our array will be.This is what I need you to listen very carefully to my directions.We have several things.That’s not okay, Student T.  We are going to just lay the animal down, but these people in the middle are going to stand up and push their chair in, and then I need you to listen to me.",0
"I need really good listeners.You need to pick up your animal and take it, please.Would you step back, please?I need the people on this side to stand up and pick up your animal or whatever it is you have.You can roll it up and use it but it’s going to be harder to use.",1
"I need us to move.We need the cameras to be able to see this.There we go.I don’t want – guys, you need Student J to put his animal where he wants it.Don’t count yet, please.Don’t count.Okay.Student K, I need you guys.You’re okay there.You guys are good.",0
"Can you see, Student C?Make sure you scoot up to see.Everybody here is going to step back.Everybody here is stepping back.I want you to look at this.This is your latest DBQ.I want you to look at this and tell me if this is a clear array, and you need to raise your hands for this, because we need to have a little bit of a discussion about this.",1
"We could see columns and rows.  The people that placed their animal need to come up and stand there.  No mouths again.  You’re going to reset the array.  You have 30 seconds.  No mouths.  I need you out of your chairs. I am very impressed with what I am seeing start at this end.  We need to scoot back.  Scoot way back, please.  We need to be able to see.  If the cameras can’t see, this is useless.  Okay.  I know this is a camera day.  Okay.  Now I can see much better what I’m looking at, however, I see a little bit of a situation, Student J.  If this is a perfect array, stepping back – you can see better if you step back.",1
"Oh my goodness.  It’s a remainder?  It’s okay.  I wondered if anybody was going to notice that.  Student T’s doesn’t have anybody.  Student T, talk to me in math terms about what that means.  I need you to step back, please.  I need all of you to stay back.",0
"It did not have a row.  Now I’m looking at it from this end.  I need everybody here to step back, way back.  You can even get up on the desk, some of you.  Now I see an array.  Do we still have a remainder?",0
"He was dividing by a row.  Now tell me the math problem like this.  Student K, raise your hand.  Give me the math problem like this.  Division problem.",0
"Good.  Watch.  1, 2, 3.  Isn’t that cool?  That is way cool. I’m glad we had our animals here to do this today because I think it’s pretty cool, and we’ll try to get a picture maybe later of this because I’m not going to stop right now.  The next part of our lesson is going to be our how long, how many game, which we haven’t done for a long time, and some of you have done it a lot and some of you haven’t ever done it. So we’re going to look at the board, and stay right where you are.  Let me get this back up because your computer keeps going to sleep like children do sometimes.  And we are going to need to refresh our memory about how to play this game.  I’ve got it on the board.  Some of you really need to listen to what’s going on.  You’re going to play with your partner.  I’m going to be giving you a partner, Student B and Student M, and I want to make sure we know how to do it, because today I want a winner.  So far we’ve played this game and no one’s ever really come up with a major winner.",1
"That’s what we’re going to find out.  Okay.  So I need you to look at the board and I need Student K to move.  If you would just move to a little bit different of a location, that would be so helpful.  That’s great. You’re good.  You can sit down in the chair, please. You’re looking at this piece of paper which we’re going to use.  Yours won’t need any writing on it.  I need anyone that can remember from two or three days ago when we learned how to play how long how many. Anyone that can remember what materials we need to play this game, what this game is going to show us, and how we get a winner.  So I’ll start with Student T.  Can you tell me what we need?",0
"Maybe we better wait.  Will we have a remainder today?  Close your eyes.  Think about rolling a die.  Think about how long.  Think about how many, Student M, and will we have a remainder, Student M.  Because you’re not listening to what I’m saying.  So you really need to think about what I’m saying.  Student K, what do you think?",1
"That means we would have 12 pages of factors to start putting it somewhere in this room.Today Student K and Student T are going to be partners.Student J and Student T.  Student J and Student K. We’re not going anywhere yet, guys.That’s not helping other people.",1
"I want to beat my partner because I want the most boxes.You have it?Stand up and get your material please, and get organized.Yes?",0
"Okay.  You need to sit down please, and what was your score? What are you doing here?  Show me.  You may not use this.  You need to show me what this looks like. This is a 3 and I need to see it as 3 and 6, and this is an array.  Student M, is that an array?  Remember, we’re making arrays.  Good job.  Don’t forget to put the equal sign and how it works.  I’ve got two girls unfortunately that are not working.  Do we need the animals up so they aren’t going to bother us? Student T?  We need to get started, gentlemen.  Give me 5.  One of the things when I’m walking around that I should see is everything on your paper is in the shape of what again?",0
"A rectangle.  If it is not a rectangle, you have not made what? You have not made an array.  You have the same color, way too much of the same color.  We don’t need this.  Student M, I need your attention.  Do you see theirs like that?  Okay.  Let’s get a piece of paper and start listening.  Keep it together.  We’re not dividing them.  That’s not what we want to do.  Go ahead and roll and start.  Tell me about it.  What did you roll first?",0
"Keep track of that.That’s not what we’re doing, sweetie.Thank you.Okay.Whose turn is it next?You’re black and you’re green?Have you rolled?I don’t see it.I need to see the rods.Student T and Student K, I need to see the rods out.I need to see more rods.",0
"Not everybody’s figured out how to do that.  Good job.  That’s called [inaudible], using your brain.  Yes, Student J, there are 5 rods.  Do they have to be in the bag or can they be someplace else?  You’re going to need to take whatever rods you’re looking at and put them on the paper.  It has to be 5.  You can’t add to it, sweetie.  You have to find the 5 bar.  That’s the whole purpose of the game, to find something worth 5. You need to look all over your desk, honey.  Student J, all over your desk.  Would you look all over your desk, please?  Can you help him?  There’s some right there.  Give me 5.  I know we’re doing this a lot, but I need all dice down, all rods are down, and all eyes are on me.  You’re not going to have a lot of time to do this.  The next thing you’re going to do is this, and I know a lot of you didn’t finish the game.  That’s okay.  On the back of your paper, Student J and Student S – thank you.  I asked for pencils to be down and dice to be done.  On the back of your paper you need to take the product, all of your products, and write them down in a column.  Your products can be on the right.  Your partner’s can be on the left.  Oh, how do you need to line them up?",1
"I’m so sorry, Student M.  In your place value, and if we don’t get it done today, we’re going to add them tomorrow, but everybody’s going to stop right now.  I’m sorry, Student J.  I really need people to listen.  Student S?  You’re not listening.  Your numbers will be down one side.  Your partners will be down another.  We’ll start adding, and you guys can use – do you know how to apply numbers with 10?  Use your number patterns to 10.  Everybody is working on addition right now and I will come around and clean up the mess.  All you have to worry about is addition right now.  Help them out.  This is not what we’re doing.  You and Student K are working together on this.  Student J, you need to be helping her.  Girls, that is not what we’re doing at all.  It is not good for time if you’re not doing what we need to be doing on the back.  You need to find it, sweetie.  These are from all the other places.  Thank you.  You’re supposed to be helping.  Girls, you need to be adding.  I need you to help him.  Student M, I need you doing what you’re supposed to be doing.  Thanks.  This is not your job.  Thank you very much.  Whose is this? Girls, have you got it added?  Then we’re not talking.  Student B, you’re not helping Student H at all.",1
"That's correct.  Student S, you're finished.  You may go back to your seat.",1
"We're not doing the whole paper right now.  We don't have enough time to do the whole paper unfortunately.  Okay. Very good.  You may go to your seat.  Mrs. A, when you all get to a stopping point, let's go ahead and switch.  The only problem that we've got here, Student K, is you've got to have a two digit number now.  So even though this one rounded to the 4, you can't forget about the 2.  What you're saying is 23 and ninety-four hundredths rounds to 4. Does that make sense?  No.  It's not going to round to 4. What's it going to round to?  Forget about this one right here.  What two numbers – Student J – what would 23 and ninety-four hundredths be in between on the number line? Good, Student J, you're done.  You're done Student D.  I think you've got it.  Take your pencil with you.  It's going to be in between 23, and what's the very next number?",1
"The 9 rounds the 3 to a 4, good.  I need to see this time Student T, Student E, Student C, Student A, Student H, and Student E.  Mrs. A's group, you need to take a pencil with you, Student H, Student A, Student J, Student D, Student W and Student J.  Take a pencil.  My group, you need to bring your practice workbook.  Go get your practice workbook, the one you usually use for homework.  We're going to use it in class today.  Get your practice workbook and your pencil. Student R, and Student A, Student K, Student N, and Student K, you should be at your seats working on the mode, median, and range page.  What have you got with you?",0
"That's what I was afraid of.  Today I am prepared.  I knew you might not have it with you since we don't usually do it in class.  The mode, median, and range page, Student R. There's one on my desk.  Okay.  Student D, look at me.  Who are we missing over here?  Student T.  Student H, I need you to sit all the way down please, on your bottom.  I want you to open your practice workbook up to 19.2.  I don't want you to start yet.  19.2.",1
"That's right.  On my grocery list over on the side I write a 2, and if something was $3.94, I would write a 4, because it's really close to $4.00.  Student A, your seat work time is independent.  Okay.  That's what we're going to do on this page right here.  Student H, I need you listening.  You need to round first.  So on your paper there where it says one and five tenths you are going to round to the nearest whole number.  Who can tell me which of these digits is the whole number?  Student C?",0
"See how eight down there has the dollar sign?  We're still rounding.  Don't tap on me please.  Student H, if you're going to ask me a question, listen to the answer.  Thank you.  We're still rounding to the whole number.  Even though there's a hundredths place, it doesn't change it.",0
"2.  Okay.  So when there's a hundredths place, don't let that scare you.  We're still rounding to the nearest whole number, and what place value does that mean you're going to round to when it says the nearest whole number?  Stop for a minute, because you're not listening to me.  Stop.  Look at me.",1
"No.  I want you to look at me and listen.  When it says to round to the nearest whole number – let go of your pencil. When it says to round to the nearest whole number, what place value are you rounding to, Student E?",0
"You have more done.Student J, Student A, Student N, and Student W, you need to bring your purple practice workbook.Student R, practice workbook, and a pencil, the whole thing.Just bring your workbook and a pencil.The purple homework workbook, the one you usually use for homework, we're going to work some in class today.",0
"Hang on.We'll find a place for everybody.Student R, why don't you just use this chair?Student N, can you slide that way a little bit?This group's a little bit bigger.You can have the chair.I'm not going to sit down.Student A, just pull up to the corner right there, honey.",0
"Very good.  So the 5 tells the 1 to go up because it's moving up to the next whole number on the number line.  That's what you're doing when you're rounding.  You're just saying it's closer to the 2.  So we're going to round it to a whole number.  We're just going to make it a 2.  It's that simple.  If we have one and two tenths, let's put that on the number line.  Student A, why don't you come and put one and two tenths on our number line up here?  Student A, can you pull your chair up just a little bit so she can get through here?  It's all right if it overlaps a little bit. Let's line the arrow right up with it.  Okay.  There's our one and two tenths.  Now look at that one and two tenths. Which whole number is it closer to, Student J?",0
"You like checking it, don't you, Student N?  Good.  Let me see yours.  Good.  You three have got it.  You can leave. Watch out for the camera.  Good.  Good.  You've got it. You can go.  If I check that one, you can go.",0
Not yet.  I need you to have a seat and wait until we get changed from math.  I can't see it.  My eyes aren't that good.  Good.  You've got it.  Everybody got it.  Excellent.,0
"All the teachers that are being observed have a number so that when they're looking at the film they can keep up with who it was, because they don't know us by our name.  That's how they're keeping up with who it was.  He asked what the numbers were for that we had to hold up in front of the camera.  Good.  I need everybody to go back to your seats. Those of you standing in the back, go back to your seats please.  Student R, go back to your seat.",1
Not yet.  I need you to sit down and listen to these directions.  When math is completely over.  How much have you got left?  You all need to finish them.  Work on them while you're waiting.  You've got several minutes now.  I want Student R and Student J to go to your own chair and sit down.  No.  I want you to sit down and listen to directions.,0
"Come on, Student N.  Okay.  18.4.  All you've got to do is put it in the T-chart.  Look at the first place.  Remember how we were showing you how to put them on a T-chart and line them up?  Okay.  If you are in Ms. N's or Ms. R's classes, you may leave.  18.4 for tomorrow.  Bring that along with you with yesterday's homework.  Go over and look on that black tray.  That's where I put the extras.  Student R and Student H, hands off.  If you need an extra night to get it done, you can have it.  Math is over.  I'm not really sure what to do here.",0
"Difference, find the difference.Okay.That's the subtraction one.All right.Very good.I'm going to remind you of your groups from yesterday.Our first group is going to Mrs. A.Student A, I need you not to do that while I'm talking, please.",0
"Oh, I don’t want you doing it on the paper.  I want you doing it with the materials.  Let’s go back to the materials.  You started with how many flats?",1
"I’m looking for a group that transitions quickly and quietly.Ask your group members.Stay with your group members, Student L, the whole time.Student S, you will need to get the clipboard from back there with the recording sheets if you guys haven’t got a recording sheet yet.",0
"I think so.  Okay.  We’re not quite finished with his.  We’re going to stop for today.  I want you to be thinking about what kind of fractions are up above the number lines, so next time we get together as a group, we’ll work on putting our fractions on top of there, okay? Okay.  I need every group to clean up and transition quietly back to our tables for our wrap-up.  Looking for the first group settled quietly into their tables.  If we can return all materials.",1
"Figuring out where it was on the number line?  Okay, Student K? Stand up and face the class so they can hear you.",0
Okay.  So you did like one piece at a time and separating them out into the groups?  I want to hear about the exemplars.  How did it go in the exemplar group today?  Anybody want to share how it went in their group?  Student D?  Stand up.  We need some more details besides it was easy.  It was easy compared to what?,0
"And you went to games, right?  So go back to games for a couple minutes.  The Odds are at games.  The Fantastic 6s are at exemplars for a few minutes.  The Math [inaudible] are checking homework for a few minutes, and the X Brain Cells are with me.  Look at the chart.  Okay.  We’re waiting for Student G in our group.  Student L, I think you’re with the group that’s games right now, but I think you need to come with me today since you missed this yesterday.  I want you to make up this.  She’s in our group now.",1
"Just for today.  Don’t worry about it.  Just set it back.  In fact you can leave them there because – well, just set them out of the way.  It’s fine.  Okay.  Just use loose notebook paper for now and put it in your math folder, and we’ll find it later.  Okay.  We are also going to be working on decimal number lines today talking about where decimals live on the number line, building on – and when we get to our decimal from the story problem today, 0.125, you can tell me where you think it belongs on the number line.  So let’s start by drawing a number line.  You might want to turn your journal sideways so you have more room, and we’re going to go between 0 and 1.  You don’t have to turn it sideways if you think you can fit it all in, but I think it might work better.  That’s fine.  Who can tell me, what would be halfway between 0 and 1? I kind of gave it away.  Student R?",0
"I’m concerned about the noise level over here.Student D, I’m concerned about this group’s noise level because I have to be able to hear this group over there, so you guys need to whisper.High five everybody for a minute.I just wanted to remind you that I’m looking for the group that does the best job of communicating in quiet voices today.",1
Is there a reason your group has not picked up your exemplars yet?They’re on the clipboard.You need to pick them up off the clipboard and bring them over here.Did somebody take the exemplars home yesterday and didn’t bring them back?I had five yesterday and I only have two today.,0
"You guys will have to share in the group because somebody took those exemplars yesterday.Let me see those for a minute, Student D. I gave Student G – you all just share.Okay.Okay.Student D, if you would just slide a bit to your right, please?Yeah, your right.",1
"Same pattern.  I love it.  It’s all full of patterns.  Same pattern as the one we did up above it.  So put four tick marks on each side and go ahead and fill in what decimals are at each of those tick marks and I’ll let somebody put them up here.  While you’re doing that, I’m going to check on the other groups really quick. Student D, you can pull up a chair if you want to sit.  You can stand if you want to.  That’s fine. Okay.  Who wants to tell us what tick marks go up here, I mean, what decimals?  Okay, Student L.",0
What did you do?  No.  Please stop.  Thank you.,0
"You shouldn’t have had that 0 there.  That’s where you messed up.  You don’t put the 0 up there just because you can’t divide into that number down there.  You just pull down the next number.  Oops.  All right.  We’re going to play a quick game before we break up into groups.  You need to find the matching set.  You need to have your eyes up here on the screen, paying attention.  It’s memory, honey.  Let’s see.  You think green and green go?  Let’s check.  They do. Please don’t yell out.  Student L, come on up.  It’s kind of hard to see the colors.  You’re not writing this down.  Wait.  Is four fifths the same as twenty- five hundredths?",0
"So what’s going to happen is you are going to get in groups of two or three.You need to pick smart choices for your partners.Do not pick people that you’re best friends with, or you know you’re going to spend the entire time talking and goofing around with.",1
"So I’m going to put my larger number outside the house because he’s the horse, my smaller number inside the house because that’s the cowboy, then I’m going to divide. Once you do your five questions, that will be up here.  Actually  you’re just going to need one paper per group.  If we run out, just do one per group. For now everyone plan on taking one.  Those five questions need to get answered without talking right now, then you can move into your groups.  Seven ninths, 9 into 7.  So what do you put when it keeps going?  The bar.  Have a seat and do those, please. I will be checking them when you go to science today. We’re not getting there yet.  Let’s drop it.  My friends over here, Student A, get out of my chair. You need to squat down so you can all see.  We were talking about simplifying fractions while you guys were testing still.  Can you just stand?  It won’t take long.  That’s not math talk right now.  If I have a fraction like 4 over 6, what I want to do is simplify it.  Thank you.  To simplify it, I need to find – Student N, come sit by me.  Sit by me.  All right.  So we have a 4 and a 6.  We need to list all of our factors.  We have 1.  What else?  2.  Thank you.  What about for 6?",1
"Student L, thank you for raising your hand.  6.  6 times 5 is 30.  You should be writing that on the notes page to the right of your cowboy and horse.  30, all the way down.  All right.  Everyone have it written down?",0
"75.  I liked how she went ahead though and simplified it first because you may end up simplifying it to a fraction you know and you won’t have to do the division. Student D, will you please come and do the second one?  You weren’t here.  You were testing.  I’ll pull you in a few minutes when they break apart and we’ll do it.  You got pulled out of the room?  What did you get pulled out of the room for?",1
"3?  3 by 4 or 4 by 3, and I think I’m missing one, right? Raise your hand, guys.  Student C, what am I missing?",0
"Can you raise your hands, please?  Student H?",0
"Why do we call it square units?  Boys and girls, can you stop drawing and erasing?  Why would we call it square units?  It’s pretty self explanatory.  Why would we call it square units?  Student J?",0
"You can’t do 8 times 4 because now you’re trying to figure out this portion.  Hold on.  We’ll go onto this.  With your partners, you’re going to – okay.  You and your partner are going to get one of these posters, and you have to measure how many – you have to find out the area of each figure, okay?  So you and your partner will work one at a time.  Student J, I’m here, please.  You’re going to measure how many square units are in each one on here.  Yes.  Try not to write on it.  Try to write it on a piece of paper in your math journal or on your whiteboard.  That’s fine.  But, you’re going to get a packet of squares, and you’re going to see how many are in here.  Now if you’re in my focus and math academy, you guys are not going to get – you’re going to get one square and figure out using that one square how many is in here. You only get one.  I was like, maybe I should not give them any but one, one single one.  Student A and Student H, you two also get one.  So does anybody else have a question about this assignment?  You’re figuring out what the area of each figure it.  You’ve got this and this, and maybe even this one, but then it starts to get a little wacky.  There’s none in the back.  Any questions before we begin?  Yes?",0
"Can you tell me something about their angles?  Raise your hand, please.",0
"Yes, he was.  Good job.  Now how much is that – what does two and one fourth equal in money?  Raise your hand. Student C?",0
"Turn that volume down please, sir.",0
"So what do I do with the 8?  I underline it and I look to the right.  Okay.  Five or more, raise the score, four or less, let it rest.  So this is a 7.  That’s more than 5, right?  So I’m going to raise the score.  It’s nineteen and five tenths.  I can add that zero there if I want to, but if there’s a zero at the end, it doesn’t really matter, correct?  Okay.  Make sure you’re working with a pen.  Wait a minute.  I lied. Rounding to the tenths place.  What place is the tenths?  Where is your homework, Student H?",0
"So that means I’m looking to the right, and five or more, raise the score.  That six becomes a seven and I add a zero.  The zero, again, does not have to be there. Student M, if you’ll look on the corner of the table up there, there should be one that you can follow along with us.  Nine and three thousandths.  What digit am I rounding to here?",0
"All right.  Now, Student J, because that was just too easy.  I want you to call on Student C because she has a question.",1
"This is not homework.This you need to bring to class tomorrow.I don’t think everybody got through it.If you were in group one, you need to make sure Student C collects your homework and turns it in.If you have a computer you need to shut it down and make sure it gets plugged back into the laptop heart, please.",0
"Make sure you write down your homework.Yes, you may use the restroom.You do have to do this.Yes, you do.",0
Probably not.  All right.  Talk to us.  Be nice and loud.,0
"It is here on the corner of this table.Group one, raise your hand.We’re going to follow this chart backwards, I believe.Group one is going to go to the computers first.Okay.I don’t think you’ll ever get to [inaudible].It’s all right.Group two, raise your hand.",0
"Group three, raise your hand.You are at independent first.Now the first page of independent work you are doing is comparing, ordering, because this is what we worked on yesterday, and it should be fresh.You should have both pages of independent work, okay?",1
Any questions?When do you interrupt the teacher during group?,0
"When you’re dead, dying, or bleeding.  Exactly.  You don’t.  If your computer doesn’t work, you solve the problem independently.  It’s not an issue I’m going to deal with.  There are plenty of math games you can get back there to play if all of the computers don’t work, which is very unlikely, okay?  You have 30 seconds to get to where you need to be.  I’m going to be over here.  Okay.  Let’s do what we’re supposed to be doing, all right?  Slide one over.  All right. Math is in here, not outside the window.  Let’s look at these.  In the first section, it said to round to the nearest tenth.  Let’s do homework first.  Does everybody have something to check with other than a pencil?  Sit.  I didn’t ask you to get up.  All right.  Make sure – please don’t click the pens, and make sure it gets back into the bucket.  Scribble around.  Directions.  It says round to the nearest tenth.  So you have nineteen and eighty-seven thousandths.  Which digit is in the tenths place? Student F?",0
"Five or more, raise the score, four or less, give it a rest. This is more than five, so raise the score.  That then becomes nineteen and one tenth, and everything to the right of that underlined digit becomes a zero. If the pen isn’t still working, then pass pens around so you can check because it’s not something we’re going to sit here and fiddle with.  Number two, nine and thirty-three hundredths.  I ask what digit, you’re going to tell me a three.  Which three is it, Student M?",1
"Something else I noticed that was very good, Student K in the back, she was – one person really didn’t understand how they arrived at an answer, and she actually took the time to show them before they went on to the next problem.  I think that was very good that you guys were helping each other out and not putting each other down.  That was positive.  Yes?",0
"I know you like the easier ones, but does that challenge you? If there’s never a challenge, then how are you going to rise above what you are right now?  We’re all here to grow and grow in a positive direction, meaning to learn more, and we learn from one another just like I learned from you guys, and you guys learned from me, okay?  Okay.  Now Student C is going to come around. If you have a calculator, hold it up.  Student C will collect the calculators since he feels empowered with the calculators.  I’m going to have Student M go ahead and collect the dry erase boards.  Make sure all of it is erased.  The paper towels, Student C, can you collect paper towels and just throw them away for me?  Thank you.",0
"196.  Right.  You guys, listen.  It has to be fast.  All right. Listen.  It’s only going to work this well if you behave.  Now I gave them a two digit number multiplied by a one digit.  Let’s see if I can give them something a little easier to see how they do. You ready?  I’m going to call this one out because I don’t see one that’s easy on there.",1
"You need two dry erase boards.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Student B, come with me back here.  Okay.  Student S, go back there.  Go back there, Student S.  Okay.  They have four.  It’s only two?  Oh, that’s because I had to send out Student J and Student E.  Hold on.  I have two boys over here.  Hold on.  You guys, okay.  Okay. We’re going to do a quick modification, and the reason why we’re going to do a quick modification, is because when I was up here doing the calculations with the other guys, they weren’t quite ready for it. They weren’t as fast.  So the modification is you’re going up against the other person that has the dry erase board.  So the first person – excuse me.  The first person that comes up with the answer wins, and that person would get that point.  We need one person, two people with the dry erase boards, okay? One person calling out.  The other person gets to judge who comes up with the answer first, all right? So does everybody understand what to do?  What if in the event that you have two people that finish, and the person that finished first didn’t have the correct answer?  What do you do then?  What do you think is the fairest thing to do then?  Yes?",1
"2 times 70.Student R, [inaudible].Listen.Okay.Now the people with the dry erase boards, you need to give it to the other people.Switch.If you have the book, pass that book to the people that had the dry erase boards.Now the people who were working out the problems, Student L is the keeper because she didn’t work out the problems.",1
"Okay. Student S, can you sit down with them so I don’t hear that person’s voice over everybody else’s? All right.You ready? Go ahead and begin. If you have a calculator, you have to wait until they finish.You can’t call it out.You’re checking their answers to see if they’re correct.",1
"Come closer.You don’t have answers in your book so it doesn’t matter if you sit close, so that everybody can hear you in this group.Select another one.",1
He gets a tally mark for that one.  You’ve got to listen.  Who is supposed to have the dry erase board?  Okay.,1
Can you hear Student B?,0
Why did you feel frustrated?  What made it frustrating?,0
"All right, so we talked about yesterday already, right?  Great, great, great, great, great.  I want you guys to pull out your homework please.  You had homework Monday.  Pull it out.",0
"No, okay.  Raise your hand if taking notes like this and keeping them in your notebook if it helps you.",0
"I said raise your hand.  I didn't ask for a verbal response. Okay?  All right, I know the purple is hard to see so I will read it to you.  I don't know what is going on with my colors here, but put the zeroes – put in the zeroes so that the numbers have the same length.  Put in zeroes so that the numbers have the same length.  I know it might be a little confusing now, but I will show you on the next slide what this means.  Yes, ma'am?",1
"Okay, I can't help you guys if you leave homework in your backpack.  When you come to class where is your homework supposed to be?  Student Z?",0
"In your homework folder or with you.  Make sure that you are bringing these things to class.  When you get to middle school you can't go back to your locker to go get this and go get that.  Okay?  You'll be okay today without it, Student R, because I'm not collecting it, but please remember tomorrow to bring your homework in. All right, so your homework on Monday, you had a place value sheet. It says write the place and value of each number.  I just want to go over it real quick just to make sure that we all understand – excuse me – what's going on here, okay?  The first question says what place is the selected digit in? When they say place, what do we mean by place?  When we say place what do we mean by place?  Student Z?",1
"Not right now.  We have six minutes.  Can you hold it for six minutes?  All right, six minutes.  Hold it, hold it, hold it.  All right, while you guys are working on that.  Line up the dot and give it all you got.  Student L, can you turn the lights on for me?  There's a lot of talking. There should be no one else talking right now except for?",1
You have to focus here.  Sh.  He needs focus.  Sh.  Sh.  Okay.,1
"Okay, yes, he is correct.  Let's give Student S a snap for that.  I'm going to give – let me see, I'll try.  Okay, so I'm going to do one more example.  It's going to be a little bit more difficult for you to do.",0
I'm going to call on people who are quietly waiting to be called on.  Student R?,0
Let's give our undivided attention to Student R.  You missed a number.  You missed a number.,0
"I'll wait.  I don't know why people are out of their chairs.  I don't know why people are doing their own thing.  Just leave everything on your desk as is.  Student A.  You're going to head to the computer lab.  By now, I expect most of you to be done with the section on multiplication.  In the computer lab, a lot of you should be started the section on decimals.  If you are not done with the multiplication, I need you to get in there and focus.  I need you to work.  Same seats as always.  So please do not move your seat.",0
"Student C?  Quickly.  All right, please line up in number order quietly.  In number order quietly.  You're gonna join us in the computer lab.  Yes.  Thank you.  Guys, do not play with the camera.  Please line up quietly.  Please line up quietly.  Sh.  All right, let's go.",0
"Six tenths.  Great job.  All right, your homework tonight is going to be very similar to this.  So make sure that you take it home.  Make sure that you do it.  Make sure it gets done.  Make sure it comes back with you tomorrow.  Tomorrow is Thursday.  You're going to get back to centers tomorrow. It's been a while because of the storm and we haven't had a full week of school in like a month.  So tomorrow we are going to do centers.  Make sure that you come prepared. You need to bring your notebook tomorrow.  You don't need to bring your math journal volume one and volume two. Student F, whatever is in the desk that is more interesting than what I'm saying, I would like to see.  Two pieces of paper are more interesting than me?  Are you saying that I am –",1
"– more boring than a sheet of paper?  Okay, so please put it away.  Good.  Okay, we are going to do centers tomorrow. You do not need to bring your math journal one and two. You just need to bring your math notebook and coloring tools.  Please do not come in here tomorrow without your coloring tools.  You need your markers, crayons, colored pencils, or whatever.  You need to make sure you have. What's wrong?",0
"Please turn to page 56.  Student L, lights.  Thank you, ma'am. All right, can someone take a guess at what we're going to be learning today?  Someone take a guess.  I know it's like pulling something out of thin air, but can someone take a guess?  What are we doing today, Student K?",0
"No, you're taking notes.  We're just going to glue them in your notebook.",1
"You've been taking notes long enough to be able to decipher what you need to do, what's going on with your notes. Student F, I need that desk cleaned out today by 3:15. I'll give you till 3:30.  Ouch.  Did you guys take notes like this last year?",0
"Good morning, class.  So today we’re going to continue working on patterns, as we have been.  What we’re going to do today is there’s going be several stations, as we’ve done before. So right now you guys are quietly working on your ‘do- now,’ you guys have 15 – or we’ll go with ten minutes to complete as much of it as possible.  Once you finish that we’re going to go ahead, quickly review, and then we’re going to go ahead and break off into our stations to continue focusing in on our patter review, all right? At the end of class we have a quiz.  So before you guys get ready to take to the quiz I’ll go ahead and give you about five minutes to continue on to review.  So one of the stations, during our work-station rotation, up here on the promethium board – promethium station, you guys are doing the same thing as the group that was up here yesterday; so you’re going to be focusing in on locating the aliens using the [corner] grid.",1
Shh.  Adding.  Four plus zero?,0
"Student C, stay focused.  You’re all done?  So go ahead and review, all right, because you have review at the end of class.  Your quiz at the end of class is focusing in on patterns.  So if you’re finishing up early I suggest you review your notes for patterns, all right?  You’re reviewing your notes for patterns; you’re reviewing the problems that we’ve done for patterns.  Your pattern quiz will have one- and two-step problems, all right?  They will all be numerical, which means they’re all numbers.",1
"Student J, pay attention.  Quadrant four.  Let’s check to see if Student M is correct.  I’ll go over one and I’ll go down six.  Excellent job.  All right.",0
"Voices.  With that being said, we are going to go ahead and get ready to switch into our work stations.  I did not say for anybody to move.  You can quietly raise your hand.  Student M?",1
"You may.  All right, so, with that being said we’re going to rotate into our stations.  Today I am beginning with group three, so group three will be in the back with me, all right?  You are not talking.  Shh.  Group two; you’re listening.  Thank you.  Group two is starting at the – nobody is moving right now; I have not released anybody to move.  Group two, you will be at the computers.  You are on First [and] Math or ST Math.  Group one, you’re on the promethium board; you are playing the coordinated grid game, locating the A leads.",0
"Group four, you’re practicing patterns with pattern ladder, all right?  With pattern ladder.  Pattern ladder, you can play it in pairs, all right?  You can play it in pairs.  You can pick whichever color pieces you want to use as your work – your pieces to use, all right?  So quickly review on it because it seems like some of us have forgot our order, so just quickly; group one, go ahead and move to the locating aliens promethium board – that’s Student M, Student J, Student S, Student D – be careful to not crash into the camera, all right?  You are not moving by the camera because we do not want to knock it over.",1
"Group two, you may go ahead and rotate to the computers.  Group two, that’s Student A, Student C, Student D, Student J. Group three, you may go ahead and come back here; Student R, Student K, Student C, Student N and Student M. And group four, you may go ahead and get started on the game.  That’s Student E, Student K, Student J, Student M and Student J. Everyone should be quietly in their sections in the next five seconds.  All chairs should be pushed in.  I’m looking at several chairs that are not pushed in.  Five, four, three, two – pull your chair over a little bit.  Pull your chair over a little bit Student C –one and zero.",0
"All right, I should not hear anybody talking in the next five, four, three, two, one and zero.  Student C, go to Internet Explorer and then it will work.  Group number one, right now you are too loud.  It is not that serious.  Everybody is going to get a turn. All right, so over here we’re going to focus in today on patterns, all right.  Everybody should be quietly working with their groups.  Student E, what are you doing?",0
I like quiet hands.  Student M.,0
But you have to answer your question first.  Group one; you’re too loud.,0
"All right, I like how you guys are working together and trying to figure this out.  Let’s see; did we figure it out?  Who wants to give us – try?  Student C, what did you think the rule is?",0
"So, if we’re not working here on task then you guys are going to go back to your seats and you’re going to work on task there.  We’re working together quietly, all right?  I should not have to come over here again; I should not have to tell you guys to be quiet, all right?  You can do it. We’re here to be successful; we’ve got to make sure we’re doing that, all right?  You have this hyphen in there Student J in your answer.",1
"You’re over; it’s seven, comma, negative eight.  You can over – so remember, you started your origin – go over and then down.  Student D; pay attention to your group.",0
Group one; have a seat.  Have a seat.  You have a worksheet now because clearly we’re not doing what we’re supposed to be doing at the promethium board.  Group three; we’re too loud.  You guys can all sit right here at this table to work together quietly.  Maybe if we can do this correctly then we can get back to the promethium board.  Front and back.,1
"Hmm?  Have a seat; I’ll be coming right here.  All right, so – which part?",0
What is the rule?  I like quiet hands.  Student N.,0
"Work it out on your board; do not shout it out yet.  You might have different ways of solving, all right?  So I want you guys thinking about that. Good job over here you guys.  Excellent.  You’ve got to make sure you’re using the number that’s up here, along the top part. Good job over here.  Keep it up.  Excellent job you guys. You’re doing much better over here.  This is what I like to see because we’re here to learn.  Excellent.  Keep it up, okay?",1
"Yes, Student A, you may.  Student C, stay focused.  Student D and Student J.",0
"Do we need to go back to our seats?  Student D, that is not how you act.",0
"Student C and Student J; focus on that.  Student J, what are you doing?",0
"That’s not how you act.  I understand you and Student D a lot of times are not up here because you were with Miss A, but right now acting like this with your groups is not going to work.  So you guys are getting ready to lose the privilege of working with groups.  That’s not how you act.",1
"Great job you guys.  Student M, stay focused on your computer. Group focus.",0
"Oh, I’m sorry.  Student D, Student S; you’re loud.  Student A and Student J.",0
"Group one; stay focused.  All right, what do we think our pattern is?  Student J.",0
"All right.  So, hopefully with the practice we have learned – yes Student M?  Yes.  Student M is collecting the folders; I need on other volunteer.  Student M is collecting the notebooks.  All right.  So hopefully with this it has helped us to go over patterns.  Student J, sit down.  It has helped us to go over patterns, all right?  We will have a quiz.  We did not get to take it just yet so we’re going to take it shortly with the other class.  We’re going to have them wait a little bit longer so we can finish up our little final quiz, all right?  With that being said you guys are all going to demonstrate your mastery on patterns, all right?  You’ve got to show me what you know with patterns, all right?",0
So clear your desks.  You only need a pencil out.  We’re going to finish up class with the quiz.,1
"No.  What am I doing now?  First I’ve got to clean house, get rid of that so I don’t mess up, right?  I don’t want to confuse myself.  Student J, pay attention.  All right, then what do I need to do?",0
"Nineteen.  Student C, you should be paying attention.  Three times eight?",0
"So I'll ask you again, what do you think I mean when I say compare decimals?  What are you going to be doing?  Only Student T knows.  Only Student E.  Student T, what do you think I'm going to be asking you to do?  Student M, can you read the objective again for Student M?  I don't think he was listening.",0
Hm?  I can't hear you?,0
"Again, louder, because you're talking to that group.  You're not talking to your notebook.",1
Can you speak louder.,0
I can't hear you.,0
Louder.  Student E wants to hear you.  He's ready to fight.  I know Student E.  He wants to argue.,1
"Student T, he's talking Student T.  Do you mind being quiet? Can you repeat that again because she kept talking?",1
"Can you speak louder, Student T?",0
I can't hear you.  You're right.  I can't hear you though.  Can you say it louder?,1
"One more minute.  Let's see here.  Ten seconds.  All right? It's all right.  Go on in.  Just class, okay.  Okay, are we ready?  Stand up if you're ready to move on to the next thing.  All righty.  If you didn't finish, you can copy from the person sitting next to you.  So in your groups, I have several numbers here.  You see where each number is underlined?  I want you to tell me what place is it. So in your groups, identify which place is it in.  Is it in the ones place?  Is it in the tens place?  Is it in the tenths place?  Is it in the hundredths place?  So in your groups, get started.  Five minutes.  Work as a group.  As a group. So far all I hear is Student T trying to work with her group.  I don't hear any other groups trying to work with each other.  Hm-hmm, not independently.",0
"Sit there.  Where's the decimal?  [Inaudible].  So what would this be?  What would this be?  It seems like you're having trouble working with groups and that can't happen.  All of you, that's not fair if you want to be selfish and not share your knowledge with anybody else.  Why do you think I put you in a group?  To work together and to help each other.  Are any of you actually doing that?  Are any of you actually doing that?  Yes or no?  That means you're not following my directions.  Okay, so you need to work how? Not by ourselves right now.  So let's work together.  Okay, two more minutes to finish this up and then we're going to go over each one.  What do you think, Student E?  Do you agree with the choices?  The four or the six?  This is the hundredths?  Why are you –",1
"5 and 13 hundredths.  I love it.  I love it.  All righty.  So today we're going to be figuring out how to compare decimals with one another.  You're going to be using charts.  I'm going to give two to each group.  These charts are going to try to help you compare decimals with one another.  What does it mean to compare?  What do you think I mean when I mean to compare decimals?  Think about your goals for today, your objective for today.  What do I want you to do with decimals?  I'll wait because the Witnesses seem to be a little distracted, so I'll ask my question again.  What do you think I mean when I say compare?  When you compare numbers, what do you do?  Student M?",1
"99 would be an example.  Excellent.  Enough.  One, two, three, eyes on me.",0
"Sit with tolerance.  If you don't think you can sit with focus, then you're going to be sitting in a chair.  All right, one, two, three, eyes on me.",0
"Can anyone give me an example about that.  I need you in a seat, honey.  I asked you to sharpen it with the pencil sharpener at the back of the room.",1
"Thank you.  Turn the pencil, honey.  Thank you.  Take a seat. Who can give me an example?  So I'm hearing factors is what you skip count by, multiple is what you land on.  Who can give me an example about that?  Student T?",0
40.  Good job.  Take a seat.  So I gave you a factor and you showed me that you were going to land on those multiples. Is that correct?,0
"Does everyone understand that?  Student T, enough with playing with those materials.  Give me a thumbs up if you understand.  Hands down.  Raise your hand if you still need a little clarification.  Okay, good job.  First we're going to talk about multiples of 3.  Can I have you sit over there please?  Multiples of 3.  So what is this number that I gave you?",0
"Student P, final warning.  Next time I have to speak to you, you're going on a chair.  Now I want you to think about the multiples of 30.  And when we're done with that, we're going to see the relationship between the two numbers.  So what's the first number I'm starting with?  Work slowly and work together.  What's the first number?",0
Let's go slow and think.  Let's not just shout out.  So after –,1
"300.  Guys, pick it up.  We're not singing them.",0
Are you talking about these two charts right now?,0
"As a class – I'm going to wait until I have props from everybody.  Thank you.  Student T, I love the way that you're paying attention.  Student T, I love the way that you're sitting up straight, looking great.  Student T, you have a question?",0
"Oh, what do you mean?  Hold on, honey.  So right now we're focusing on what Student M saying.  You're showing props to him, okay.  You're listening to him.  You're not playing with this.  So Student M, what can you tell me about using multiplication to solve division?",1
"Student P, we don't laugh.  Flip your card.  We don't laugh at other people.  It's absolutely okay to make mistakes or say they don't know.  Teacher doesn't know anything.  Look at all these hands.  Who can explain to me the connection that they see between the multiples of 3 and multiples of 30. I'm going to call on more than one person starting with Student T.",1
I can't hear you when you're covering your hand.,1
"Okay.  Let's pay attention because right now you're going to do an activity with a partner.  Well, first I'm going to do it with a partner and then you're going to do it with a partner.  The activity we are going to do is called multiple towers.  What is called?",0
"Okay.  Let me see who's sitting up straight looking great who I could use as my partner.  Let me see.  Student M.  Student M, can I have you stand right over and let me see who my other partner is going to be?  I need another assistant. Student A.  I'm going to give you a number.  Why don't we work with the number 30.  So what number are we going to work with?",0
"All right.  So Student A and M, you two are going to work on that together to get up to this line and we're going to see how many boxes we have and how many total oranges we have. Make sense?  Get to work.  Everybody else?  One, two, three, eyes on me.",0
"I'm a little disappointed with today, okay?  So students who just came in, you're sliding right in.  Student S, sit up, please.  Yes.  Yep.  So right now those two friends over there are keeping track about how many oranges we have and how many boxes we have.  With a partner, you are going to be taking a strip of paper, okay?  You are going to be taking a strip of paper.  You will need a ruler and you are going to mark off one inch squares, okay?  So once you get an inch, you're going to draw a line across.  Measure another inch, draw a line.  Does that make sense?",0
"Does anyone have a ruler at their desk that I could borrow quickly?  Student S, could you grab me a ruler, please, from the drawer behind you?  Thank you.  So as we can see – One, two, three, eyes on me.",0
"Let's see who's sitting up straight looking great.  I'm going to put you in partners.  Student Z, go to this table. You're going to work with me, please.  Student T and S –",0
"Every group has a piece of paper.  One, two, three, eyes on me.",0
"Come over here.  Student P is going to work with me for right now.  You have a job to do, Student M.  Student J, don't bump into that.",0
"Nope, we don't need each other's help.  Student J, let's go, please.",0
Sure.  Do you want me to squoosh you?  I love the way table five is working.  So what number would we want to skip count by?,0
"So pay attention, Student P.  I need you sitting up.  Look at me.  If each of these folds is a multiple, right?  What is my third multiple?",0
"Good job, Student R.  Student P, sit up.  Otherwise we'll do this at recess tomorrow.",1
"So has everyone – excuse me.  One, two, three, eyes on me.",0
Can you talk to each other about that?  Talk to each other about that.  What is going on over here?,0
"I'll come over to you guys.  One, two, three, eyes on me.",0
"So if this is the number of oranges, we need to know the number of boxes because this is the total number of oranges. Thumbs up if you agree.  Hands down.  Raise your hand if you're confused.  Student S, how do you feel right now?",0
"So 30 times 16.  Well, we have a couple of these falling down. One, two, three, eyes on me.",0
"Nice and loud, Student N, for everybody.",1
"I am losing my patience.  You need to do these with your partners that you did the strips with.  Tables four and five.  I am, for the third time, I am coming over to help you.  Tables three, four, and five, please get your math books.  Tables one, two, and six, please get your math books.",0
"One, two, three, eyes on me.",0
"This amount of space.  Okay, I don't know what we were doing over here.  Are these inches?  This is an inch.  See one, two, three, four.  That's an inch.  Okay?  So I am making these separated by inches.  Okay, Student M and P, flip your cards.  Student P, go to Mr. L's room, please.",0
"Right.  So I'd have 50 oranges.  Open up to 37.  Student S, you just gotta listen.  For what, honey?  For what?  All right, let's do this question.  Number one, what number did you use to build your multiple tower?  What number did we use?",0
"Okay, so who can raise their hand and explain to me what is the relationship, the connection between multiplication and division?  Student R?",0
"Same in writing.  Exactly.  Use what you know to help you learn what you don't know.  So today we are going to understand the effect of multiplying multiples of 30.  We are going to look at the relationship of multiples of 3 and multiples of 30.  In addition to that – Student C, take a seat, please.",0
Shh.  Shh.  Shh.,0
Shh.,0
"We’re being videotaped.  Okay.  All right, so let’s look.  So class, listen.  Are you with me?",0
"Okay, write this down.  Shh.  Shh.  By the way, what is this number here called?",0
"Okay, let’s stop.  Okay, give yourselves a round of applause. [Clapping].  Tomorrow we will work on multiplying using our sevens.  The first thing I want you to do is to start with the math motivator.  Make sure that you have a pencil and a piece of paper out.  I’m going to give you about five minutes to work on this, the math motivator where you solve the problem. This is a review of what we’ve been working on.  We’ve been working on division using three-digit dividends by one single divisor.  I want you to solve this one problem, but not only solve it.  I also want you to explain in words the steps to solving the problem.  I want you to divide 186 by four.  Any questions on that?",1
Go ahead.  Go ahead to the restroom.  [Students working on problem].,0
"Okay, you’re with me.  Let’s go.  Come on.  [Inaudible] look at this.  Look at that, and that.  Hold that, hold that thought.  All right, I need everybody to look this way.  I need all eyes.  Hold it.  I need all eyes.  All eyes.  I’m going to explain the problem.  I want you to watch with me. Ready?",1
Okay.  Four times eight?  Write that eight above the four.  You need to go to the nurse?  What’s wrong?,0
"Here.  Put your pencil in here.  Let’s go.  Does four go into three?  No, then you want to put a zero above the three. Let’s go  Put the zero above the three.  Mm-hmm.  Yes. Maybe we can all do this together.  Let’s look real quick so I don’t have to repeat it a whole lot of times.  Now watch.  Watch.",1
"Clap three times if you can hear me.  [Clapping].  Two times if you’re with me.  [Clapping].  Five times if you got the answer.  [Clapping].  All right, let’s look.",0
"Okay, all eyes over here.  So what happens?  We put a what?",1
Shh.,0
Shh.  Let’s slow down.  Let’s slow down.  Let’s slow down.,0
"You had a few minutes to get yourself comfortable with the words on that paper.  Those are all words that – not all of them we’re going to use today, but as we introduce the unit today, those are all words that you will see over the next couple weeks.  What I’m going to ask you to do now is I’m going to ask you actually tuck your word search into your desk.",0
"Okay, as soon as you’re done, eyes up here, please.  Student R, could you put your word search in your desk, please?",0
"48?  Wow.  Okay.  Let’s take a peek.  This is everybody in the class, this is the amount of raisins they have.  So now your eyes should be up here.  Your hands are not touching your raisins.  Perhaps you should fold them and put them in your lap.  Your hands are not touching your raisins – that’s the second time now.  Thank you.  36, 38, 39, 39, 40 – this is a jumble of numbers.  It’s just one big list of numbers.  Are they in order?",0
"Yeah?  Student N, could I have you come up to the board, please?  You cannot eat your raisins yet.",0
"Can you hold this up for me?  [Inaudible.]  Very inappropriate, and I have to repeatedly talk to you when you’re talking and laughing when I’m trying to teach a lesson.  I’m not very pleased.  You will be on the wall.  Continue to argue, your only recess tomorrow too. Your chair should be on the ground and you should be sitting like a lady.",0
"How did his feet get under your chair?Thank you.Oh, this tape is sticky.All right.Thank you, my dear.You may have a seat.Okay.So I’m going to, I could draw on my whiteboard but then I’d have to erase it, right?And that would be no fun.",1
"No.  You have to space it out like I did.  Let’s see.  Student X.  Now, if Student X doesn’t do it correctly should we yell out and say, “That’s wrong”?",0
"Does anybody not like raisins?  Don’t put them back in the box because I’m going to need your box, but if someone in your group wants to munch on them, you can share them.  Only in your group.  Only in your group.  You’re not getting up across the room to share raisins.  That’s how raisins end up on the floor and stuck in your sneakers.  That’s mighty disgusting. Very good, Student M.  Alrighty.  Student N, can you do me a huge favor?  Actually, you know what?  We can just use this table.  I was going to use the other table, but this will actually stick better anyways.  If you had 30 raisins, raise your hand.  Now, I only have two 30s up there so I should only have two hands.  Who had 30 raisins?  Student D.  You should have it written down, honey. So Student T and Student D, bring your raisin box up to me, and you’re going to be our first people to show what we do, okay?  So Student D, here’s your raisin box, here’s your raisin box.  Student D, you’re going to stick it right above 30.  Good.  And Student T, you’re going to stick it right above his.  Very nice.  So how many do I have in 30? I have two.  Do you think now, I should look at my list and cross out the two 30s?",0
"Above the 32, and it should be lined up with the first one here, right?  Okay, Student D, go ahead. Oh, Miss D has an itchy eye.  What a scientist.  Make sure it’s nice and stuck on there.  There we go.  Alrighty.  So we can now cross off my 32.  How about 33?  Raise your hand if you have 33.  I should have one 33.  Student R?  Bring your raisin box on up, Student R.",1
"31 has none.  30 and 35 have the most.  Okay.  And these guys all have one.  What’s this for?  You’re 36?  I haven’t gotten there yet.  Can you have a set and be patient, young man?  All right.  So 35.  We got rid of our 35s.  Student S is on the edge of his seat.  36.  Oh boy.  I have one, two, three.  So is that the most so far?",0
Go back and sit down.  Go back and sit down.,0
"Five, four, three – see, here’s the thing that happens with collecting data.  You have to make sure you’re paying attention.  If not, it gets everything messed up.  So we’re going through one by one right now to see where I need to make a change.  Because I can’t just put 36 up there and keep my other numbers up there.  I’ve got to find out what I have to change.  Student R, go sit down for a moment, please.  Student R.  Student K.  Not yet, Student D.  Just wait five seconds, please.  Student K, 36.  Student H, 38. Student S, 36.  Student R, you told me 39.",1
"37. Can you guys sit in your chairs?  Pull your chairs and on the bottoms.  Who has 40?  Anybody?  Student J, you have 40, so you’re my only 40 up there?  So Student J, you have 40.  So I went to you after Student D?  Student N, you have 39?",0
"Go sit down, Student D.  Okay.  So people are changing their numbers and that’s not okay.  So now – no.  We need to go through and we have to see who has what.  Student K, 36?",0
"48.  Come on up, Student X.  Right above 48.  There you go. Okay.  Everybody should be sitting.  I should have your eyes up here and your hands should be touching nothing. Your hands aren’t playing with anything.  Unless you’re eating the raisins, that’s fine.  What’s the most amount of raisins in a box that we have?  Student J?",0
"Thank you, sir.Student J.Remember, I should only have to say something once and you follow the directions.Okay.And before we get started, up here is our goal for the day.Remember how in morning meeting usually we set a goal, how we’re going to behave for the day, what we’re going to do to make a good day.",0
"All right.So, the first thing we’re going to do is I’m going to give you a piece of paper towel.That’s going to go right in front of you in the middle of your desk.I’m going to give you a box of raisins.You cannot open your raisins.",0
You cannot open it yet.,0
"At the beginning of the year, remember I get those special forms that tell me if you’re allergic to anything?  We had no raisin allergies.  Good thing, huh?  Everybody has a paper towel?  Five, four, three, two, and one.  Thank you, for those people that quieted down by the count of one. Those of you that didn’t, you need to pull yourself together.  Everybody has a paper towel, yes?",1
"All right.  Thank you.  Now, Miss T, do you want to do the activity also?  Thank you.  [Inaudible] if you want to sit up here.  You don’t have to sit [inaudible].  Okay.  Now, here’s your direction.  The first step that I need you to do – did everyone squeeze it?",0
"Okay.  Once you’re done, Student J, you need to be appropriate. Student J?  Don’t ignore me when I’m speaking to you, please.   Okay.  Put your raisins down.  Raise your hand if you want to tell me how many raisins you think, just by looking at the top, are in the box.  How many do you think, Student R?",0
"Okay.  Can you please put your gum out in the barrel, please? Student J, why do we have data?",0
"We can’t just dump them out because they fall on the floor, and Miss D says “I don’t want to see them on the floor.”  We can’t use them again if you can’t use them properly.  You are going to take your raisins and you’re going to dump them out on your paper towel.  Not yet.  I haven’t said to yet.  I’m just telling you what you will be doing.  And you need to get an exact count of how many raisins.  Now, some raisins are big, some raisins are small.  Okay.  It doesn’t matter.  It’s still a raisin.  Count every piece as a raisin.  Does everybody understand that?",1
"Okay.  We’re gonna start in our center, so you need to be listening for instructions.  Table 5, tables 1 and 5 today, you’re gonna be doing something with the decimal war cards, okay.  First, you’re gonna complete this worksheet.  It has you do different things with the cards.  You’re gonna add the cards.  You’re gonna subtract the cards, compare some of the cards, and you’re gonna write some story problems. Then if you finish, you’re gonna keep playing decimal war till it’s time to change centers. As we talked about, Table 3, you’re gonna start with Five Minute Frenzy.  You should still be listening, so you know what to do when you move to the next center.  Table 6, you’re gonna be starting on the computers.  So when you go back, just be careful of the camera. You can leave your class work folders at the tables and you’re gonna meet me at the back table.  So let’s get started.  You need to get right over.  You guys need to get started right now.",1
"Come on over.  Sit down.  Come on over.  You guys actually keep moving down that way.  Student C, move over, Student I, Student M.  We want to make sure Student S has room. That’s good. ask Student M or Student C to help you, okay.  Have you done centers before?  No.  Okay.  So we’re gonna start out. Yesterday we talked a little bit about multiplication and division.  It seems like some of us are a little confused about what to do.  I will make you take this one.  Here you go.",1
"It starts with an L.  Student B, you need to focus and not be a distraction.  You should be focused, too, because even though you might have saw this I’m not sure you could explain it, explain how to do it.  We call them landmark numbers.  You looked at the math [inaudible].  Remember we talked about landmark numbers.  In third grade you had a unit called building on landmark numbers.  So what do we do first, Student B?  What am I gonna multiply 30 by?",1
Not you.  I’m talking to Student A.,0
"Yes.  Now you can try.  Erase your board.  You can try doing this on your paper, okay, two different ways.",0
"Student A.  And, Student N, you’re working with Student J.",0
"Let’s see.  First draw a box and divide it into fours.  Next, put the numbers you want to solve like this.  Next time when you do it I want you to explain step by step.  But I got what you’re doing and that was a good first try at explaining your thinking, and you do have some of the steps, but we want to be very specific, okay.  Student R, try to solve this two ways.  So everyone is doing great. You were able to solve things two different ways.  I have your pencil.  Solve things two different ways, which is great. to solve correctly.  Student M.  Yeah.  Student A, where are you guys at?  Okay, put that in the bin.  Student A, let me see your timer. Okay, you need to clean up at Tables 1 and 5.  The decimal cards – no one should be moving yet, except you guys can move back to Table 3.  The decimal cards need to be put back in the bags and then they need to be put in the folder.  No one is moving yet.",1
"Yep.  What I want you to do is when you have free time today finish this up, okay.  If you are done, that’s fine. You’re gonna solve two ways and write a story problem. didn’t tell anyone to leave yet.  Can I see your paper and pencil for a second?  Student I, when you get a chance you’re gonna solve this two ways and write a story problem. What I’d like you to do, erase your board.  Put your marker and your eraser on top of it.  You can guys can head back to Tables 1 and 5.  Yes.",0
"Student R, why would you go there, you and Student A?  You never go to that table.  What did I tell you to do with your folders?  [Inaudible].  Student A or Student B, set the timer right now.  Student A.",0
Can you please stop?  You’re being a distraction.  Now what are we gonna multiply here?,1
"600.  So put that in there.  And what is 30 times 7.  Student B, you’re raising your voice and you’re disrupting our group.  So you and Student N need to figure out what’s going on.",0
Okay.  Then you need to work on whatever it is you’re working on and not be disruptive.,0
"Yes, one, zero.  Most of you are still doing addition.  We’ll figure it out.  We’ll talk about it more after.  Okay. We’re gonna clean up centers.  So right now what I need you to do, people on the computers go over to Table 3.  People at Tables 1 and 5, you’re gonna clean up the decimal cards. And people, erase your boards.",1
"No, you’re gonna go back to your table.",1
"I know.  Some people need a lot of directions.  You don’t need your folder, Student A.  Leave it there and head to the computer.  Let’s go.  [Inaudible].  Exactly.  Very good. You have to work on that again.  Yes.",0
"Remember, go to 15, Student A.  Student A, I don't know why you’re over there.  This is not the first time doing centers.  I didn’t ask you to switch.  Okay.  We’re gonna take a look right now at the strategy.  Can anyone tell me one way that they figured this out?",0
"Adios.  [Music out].  Okay, Student J, can you get the lights for one sec?  Oh, you know what?  Let’s leave those lights out.  We’re going to take a look at the Elmo.",1
"Okay, let’s do another one, and we’re going to use just unit fractions for now, and then we’ll go on and use something else, okay?  This is my next example, except it doesn’t want to sit straight.  Okay?  Again, does not want to sit straight. All right, there’s my whole, there’s one-half, and this is my other fraction.  What did I just put up?  Did I ask you not to take out your fraction strips, yet?  And I have people pulling them out of their desks, being distracted, and not paying attention. Some of you are sitting quietly.  Paying attention to the Elmo.  Congratulations.  Good for you.  Student C, do you have an emergency, or are you going to tell me all about what I just put up here?",0
"Can you turn the lights on, honey?  And then I’m going to give you your centers for today.  Fraction Compare is going to be my first center.  Can you hand it over there, Student C, please?  Don’t touch it yet, guys, ‘cause I’ll be over there in a minute to show you what to do, okay? My second center is, Creating Equivalent Fractions.  You’re going to need your fraction strips for this, okay?  So if you do have your fraction strips in your desk, take them out.  If you don’t -",1
"Find all the ways to make one-half, using pieces in your fraction, okay?  Those are your directions.  Read the directions carefully two times before you start.  This group right here.  Think Together, okay?  Partners.  Think Together.  Read the directions two times before you start. And this is your “Think Together”.  Did I tell you to take out your fraction strips?  This group?",0
"When I get to you when we compare fractions, then you can take out your fraction strips, okay?  Just … just one second, honey.  This group is also doing, “Think Together” okay? read the directions two times, before you start.  Okay, what’s the problem?",1
"No, they’re fine for right now, okay?  They’re fine for right now.  You guys are all set?",0
"Okay, Fraction Compare.  Uh … let’s have … hmm.  All right, let’s have Student B, and Student S, and Student E, in this group, and Student A, and Student J in this group, okay? I’m going to read the directions.  Don’t open anything, yet.",0
"I want you to turn your desk around.  [Inaudible].  [Desk moving].  And since you guys are three, Student J’s going to go twice, okay?  You’re going to go with - Student B, after Student E, okay?  So let me get your stickies.",0
"Oh, look.  You guys are on top of things.  Good.  Are you sitting with Student H, Student L?  You only need one set of fraction strips, honey.  Just one set, okay, because you don’t want to mix them up.",1
"That’s what you have to find out, all right?  Now do you understand [inaudible]?  Put these away, please.  One. Two.  Three.  Four.  Leave those alone.  Yes.  [Inaudible] talk about it.",0
"If the camera is in the way, you can very, very, very carefully, move yourself closer, okay?  Or to the side, so you can see.  Somebody can sit in Student H’s seat.",0
"I will find some tissues.  Have a seat for one second, okay?",0
"Student J, honey.  What are you doing?  Now it’s Student J’s turn, okay?  You guys are taking turns.  This is Thinking Together, not think by ourselves, all right?  Okay?  Go ahead, Student J, and you listen.  Tissues.",1
"How are we doing Student E?  [Inaudible] a seat, honey.",0
"Why don’t you clean up, because we’re going to wrap it up.",1
"[Inaudible].  Wow.  Noise level.  Much, much too loud.  Take it down.  How many?",0
Shh.  Girls and boys.,0
"Thank you.  All right, we’re going to wrap up our day.  How many people were working with equivalent fractions?  Raise your hands.",0
"Smaller the fraction, all righty?  Excellent.  Okay, clean up. Center work [inaudible] in the center of your desks, please.  Student M, that’s you.  Come on.  Chop.  Chop. Please look on the floor.  Make sure there are no fraction strips -",0
"Shh.  You may use the bathroom.  [Inaudible] your desk, please. All of it, before you leave.",0
"Student J, can you collect the centers, and put them over there on the small desks for me, please?  Student T, collect your center work, and put it on the small desks for me there, please?  Student C, collect your center work.  Look, honey. Over on the small desks.  And this group has a lot of cleaning up to do.  Let’s go.  Quickly.  Come on, Student C.  Boys, move your clips.",0
As a group.  You sit like always.,0
8 by 7.  I didn't hear you.,0
Raise your hand.  Has he gone completely around the rectangle? Yes with your hands up.,0
Somebody said it.  Say it again.,0
Not right now because right now I'm gonna explain something about the homework.  And actually – but you need the homework out on your desk.,1
"No, I want you to sit down, please.",0
"Five, four, three, two, one.  Student L.  One person per table. Please put the tiles back on the counters.  Student J, can you go open the door for me please?  Student D, watch the chair please.",0
Boys and girls I’m gonna ask you if we could break down the voices to our six inch voices.  So only the people in your own group can hear you.  I don’t want to hear you.  Okay? I’ll be right there.,1
All right.  Boys and girls.  One more reminder.  Our voices are too loud.  It’s very hard to hear.  Okay.  So if we’re going to continue activities like this it needs to be six inch voices.  If I can hear you and I’m standing here I’m not within six inches of anyone right now.  I shouldn’t hear anybody’s voice.  I shouldn’t distinguish anyone’s voice.  [Inaudible],1
"Yes.  I said bring a piece of paper.  Don’t tell us the solid. Just tell us the attributes.  What the solids have.  So you could stand right at the front of the room.  I’ll wait and I would wait too, Student, I would be looking at your paper.  And I would just read off what your solid has.",0
You can call on someone?  Remember I already said that people calling out and making noises they’re not children we’re gonna call on.,1
"Roll all the way around in a circle where a hemisphere just kind of rolls in place.  So that could have been something that you could have distinguished.  But that was a good guess.  All right.  We’ll do one more for today.  Student. Come right up.  Don’t tell us.  Try to pick one that you think will trick the audience or be tricky to figure out. Okay, we need to be good listeners.",1
Very good.  Excellent job.  All right boys and girls what I’d like you to do right now is put this paper where you were describing the solids please put it in your red math folder.  Close up your binders and return to your seats.,0
"I like how nicely Student is moving quietly, pushing her chair in.  Student just bring your chair around in front. Student.  Excellent.",0
"Okay.  Student A, the directions were [inaudible].  All right, [inaudible], I’ll wait.  I’ll wait.  The warm-up, the warm- up is gonna be on this sheet.  I’m gonna give you guys three minutes – you look at this graph which is the same graph on the board.  You are going to count the number of students, number of boys, number of girls.  Same as yesterday.",0
"Look up here, look up here.",0
"[inaudible]  Don’t come up to me – I’m working with somebody. I’ll come to you.  Or, Student C seems to understand what’s going on – Student G seems to understand.  You can come to them.  Yes?  [inaudible] the answer, so what don’t you understand?",1
"For H?  The first thing you have to do is find how many girls – first find the fraction of girls that chose red and pink. That’s the first thing.  Because they want a percentage and [inaudible] the fraction.  You’re [inaudible] the boys. You get your fraction then the percentage, do the same thing with boys, and then you compare [inaudible].  Sit down.",0
Sit down.  Sit down.  How’d you get these numbers?,0
"If you want help with H, come to the carpet.  Or we can close it, that’s fine.  All right.  You shouldn’t have a board – no one should have a board.  I didn’t give boards out.  If you need help with H, come to the carpet. Student D, do you need help with H?  All right.",1
"All right, pencils down.  Pencils down.  I need you – I’ll explain this now.  All right, sit down, Student C, thank you. Student D, Student M, I don’t appreciate the talking. Put your pencils down.  Okay.  So, this is probably one of the easiest – I’ll wait for Christopher.  Thank you, Christopher, thank you.  This is probably one of the easiest steps.  It is really number of students, it’s just adding the total of boys and girls.  The different ways you can do it, the way I did it, is first I counted the number of boys.  Which is 13.  Then I counted the number of girls – and then added the two together.  And I got 37.  You could have done it differently.  You could have added everything and got 37.  And you could add the boys then add the girls.  I did it a different way, that’s all.  So show me a thumbs up if you got this, these numbers.  I got one, two, three [inaudible].  Thank you.  Set 4 plus 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7.  7 plus 6 is 13.  6 plus 5 is 11.  Plus 7 is 18.  18 plus 6 is 24.  What we’re gonna be doing today is I’m gonna be teaching you how to interpret a graph.  What does that mean, interpret?  Anybody know what interpret means?  Student C?",0
"Is that it, or do I – what am I looking – sit down.  Sit down. 12 what, Student D?",0
"Where do I put it?  You want to come up here and show me? Student D, you need to be on the carpet.",0
"How [inaudible] 75?  Do the fraction first before [inaudible]. Student A, please get out of that chair.  Student M – I’ll run over H.  I don’t think you were paying attention but then you did it, right?  That’s what Student A [inaudible]. Got number 13?  So what did you add up?",0
All right.  I’m gonna give you your exit card.  That means you have to answer this question in order to go to special.,1
"I need everybody in their seats.  In five, four, three, two -",0
"One.  When I give you the graph paper write your name and the date on it, and wait for further instructions.  You [inaudible]  Student A, you need to go to your seat.",0
"Student C, you need to go to your seat.  The directions are be in your seat in three, two, one.  Second direction.  Second direction, write your name and the date on the graph paper. Student D, you’re part of this.  You’re part of this.  You have graph paper, Student D?  It was, go to your seat, put your name and the date on the graph paper.  I’m gonna put a problem on the board.  It should take you – if you were paying attention – about two minutes to do it.  When you’re done with it your thumbs are gonna be up. I’ll check it and I’ll send you to special.  Put your name and the date on the graph paper.  All right, here’s your question.  What percentage – don’t say it out loud, you’re gonna do it on your sheet – what percentage of students chose blue as their favorite color?  Show me the work.",0
"On your graph paper.  No, based on that, on the graph.  And to answer your question from that graph – this question right here from that graph.  Don’t talk out loud.  That’s not a percentage.",0
"Student W, you have the first part right.  You have this part. Take it to here.  Look here for your example.  You have a calculator.  Look at the example.  To take it from a fraction to a percent, look at the example.  Okay, go to special.  Put your calculator in the bucket right there, okay?",0
"Tell me.  Be patient – put your hand down.  I didn’t give you permission to sit in that chair, Student A – you need to get off that chair.  Thank you, Student A.  Student M?",1
"Let him answer it. Student C, why is it 3 over 13 and not 3 over 37?  For that answer.  I can tell who’s paying attention.  Student W?",0
"Just thumbs up if you’re done, you don’t need to say that.",0
"How many girls?  [inaudible]  So, it’s 5 over 24.  Now – this is where it gets tougher.  If you remember from yesterday, that’s why I gave you calculators.  All right, so I need everybody’s eyes on me in 3, 2, 1 – thank you.  Thank you. Sit down, please.",1
Waiting on two people.  Thank you.  Waiting on one person. Okay.,0
"Mm hmm.  Now, Student Z, nice and loud, can you read what you wrote for your explanation for your problem?",0
"21 and 22, unit three.  Student A, that is not what you’re supposed to be doing right now.  Do you have the paper?  Is that 21 and 22?",0
21 and 22.  Don’t rip it out.  [Inaudible] rip it out?,0
"The remainder is four.  Now, but this one – how many people do I have left over?  This is people, guys.  I have 44 people that have to get into eight vans, okay?  I can – I’m gonna need what?  What is this telling me right here?  Read the question again.  Read the question out loud to me, Student Z, nice and loud.",0
"Nope, just the story.  The reason we’re doing this.  [Long pause]  Raise your hand when you have a story.  All right, Student J, tell me a story.  All right, hold on one minute.",0
"You can explain it in words, but I also have to see the math, ‘cause I’m gonna call you up to the board.  Remember how we did the multiplication?  That’s one way.  [Long pause]  No, Student H, move back now.  Negative.  Thank you.  Okay.",0
"No, you can’t.  You cannot leave this room.  Go sit down.",0
"Let’s see if anybody – Student R, you’re not at your desk, so do you need a – Student R, do you need a ruler?",0
"Student E?  Put your pencil down, sweetheart.  You need one? There you are.",0
"Put the ruler down, ‘cause it’s not playing time with the ruler.  No, no, no, no, you’re not going to go get anything.  Yeah, you’re supposed to take that out in the morning.  Amazing.  Yeah, do you need a ruler?  Put the ruler down, please.  [Speaking foreign language] okay? Right, go ahead.  Okay, so I’m going to measure, and on your ruler you have two types of measurements.  You have centimeters and the standard measure.  So make sure you use the –",1
"[Inaudible] You’re not listen – five, exactly, five.  I think someone helped you out with that.  Five, and this is –",0
"Excuse me, can you – can you wait till we take care of this, get this done here?  All right?  All right?  Thank you very much.  Okay, now that’s our content objective.  So let’s look at it, and we’re gonna read this.  We’re going to read this.  Active listening.  Read it with me.  To learn –",1
"Workspace, because I’m going to go and see and check on how you are doing the measurement.  Now, very, very important, and then after we – I’m going to give you something to measure. Want to look over here?  Sitting up nice.  Come on, let me see some energy here.  What you’re going to do – I did this, and this is what you’re going to do.  You’re going to get a measure – what shape is this?",0
"Here’s directions.So when I’m giving directions, you need to be really active listening.Let me see if I look like I’ve got active listeners here.You need to get that away from your hands, ‘cause your brain is gonna be wandering about, holding the ruler.",1
"So you’ve got – sit up nice, take a couple of deep breaths so we can think, and I’m going to have you repeat the directions to me.And I’m gonna go over this and I’m gonna tell you how we’re gonna do this.Look.These are index cards.",1
"And explain how you got it.  And you’re going to use the lines to write very nicely.  I always have some people that need to listen, okay?  Active listening, [Speaking foreign language] You got it?  All right, so you know what you’re gonna do?  So to do that, I’m gonna have some people sitting over there with – with me. No, maybe I’ll have you over here.  I’ll have you over here, so I don’t have too much moving around.  You’re going to take one of these picture cards.  I will have my helpers – my helpers take – my helpers for this week, Student G, Student R.  You’re going to go and see – take the – take the yellow, take some green.  You’re going to do one side. You’re going to give everybody one.  You need a little blue.  Okay, there you go, and there you are, all right? Once – listen for directions.  Once you get your card – Student J, my helpers, I have two.  Thank you.  Don’t worry about it.  What you’re going to do is you’re gonna take your card, your pencil and find your spot and measure it. Student E, you will take a seat over there.  Student M, you’re going to sit over here at the green table.",1
"Yes, go ahead.Go take a drink.All right.And I’m going to put – hello?Active listening.Just a minute.I have to have you stop for a minute, helpers, so that they can listen.Student E can listen that way.I’m gonna put stickers on it if you add your perimeter correctly and when you finish.",1
"Just a minute.I’ll tell you when to move, Student M, ‘cause you’re gonna sit over here with me, all right?Thank you.Look, when you finish, and I’m gonna be down in this area here.You are going to use – I have some – I think I’ll just keep these tapes here, put them on the table, on Student B’s table and that table.",1
"Okay, the distance around a figure or around anything.  I could say, “What’s the perimeter of this room?”  Okay?  And then you’re going to measure.  So right now you’re gonna be measuring.  Student C, you need to go to the other side. Student G, over here.  Student M, over here.  You need to – ‘cause I don’t want anybody across from you.  I want you to get to a nice spot to work.  So you want to quietly do that.  You cannot have anybody around you.  Get into your independent spot to work.  Yes.",1
"Yes, you can, Student M.  You can go there.  Student R, you think you – you’ll be okay to measure?  Student D, Student V, on the table over there.",0
"No, I want you on the table, ‘cause I need to watch.  No, sit over here.  Everybody in their place.  Student V, do me a favor.  I’d like you to sit in between those two so that you can monitor and see if they’re measuring okay.  I think you can do a good job.  Excuse me.  You’re fine there.  Sit there.  You get over there.  What is it, dear?",1
"No, I think you – okay, go ahead.  I can monitor you.  Student A – Student D, you’re gonna be in charge of Student A to see if he’s doing things nicely there. You know, checking his measurements.  I will check yours. If you get – hello?  Active listening.  You do not cut the yarn until you have checked it with me, okay?  So no one is talking.  Guess what I’m going to be playing?",1
"Music, and that’s what we’re gonna be hearing, is the music. Student V may talk a little bit to make sure that they’re measuring correctly. Okay, go ahead.  Are we ready?  Let me see.  Silence. We’re concentrated on our work and this is my little group that I will work with.  And then I have a nice – this is the other thing we’re gonna be playing with polygons, [Inaudible]. So – but this is gonna be another center for you.  Playing with polygons, and I will go over that.  Now, start measuring.  I want to see what you do and how you measure. Excuse me, you have to start at zero.  How are you gonna measure that?  Guys, I have to work with some of the – some of the people over here.  Show me that you can work nicely. Thank you.  Just measure one side.  What is it?",0
"The perimeter of your rectangle.  And I need to see the dimensions.  That means the length of the width and – how wide the width is and the length.  And this is what it will look like when you’re finished.  You need to be writing afterwards.  Then I’ll put a sticker on it once you have it.  I had wanted you over here.  I need to – excuse me, but you didn’t finish.  Did you finish?",0
"On the back where the lines are, my dear.  What do we write on the back?  Hold it.  I need to have everybody stop.  We need to go over the directions a little bit more, ‘cause I’m not sensing that you have it.  Hello?  Rulers, pencils, everybody – everything down.  Listen to me.  Thank you very much.  I’m going to put that, and I think that’ll be okay. I want to put this over here.  If you have a problem, I’m gonna be working with some people, and if you have a problem as to what do I do next, even though I may have gone over it – Student M, can you just leave that down? Here’s what you’re going to do. First of all – are we listening?  Look over here. Everybody can see this?  You can get up and move.  You know, movement is good for you.  Here’s my directions.  I said it, now I’m going to write it, and we’re going to read it.  Remember, math is reading, writing and thinking.  You see what he’s doing?  He’s looking at that. Is that how we learn?  You see what he has, Student E?  Did you measure it yourself?",1
"Measure.  Now we’re going to – this is telling you what to do. It’s an imperative sentence.  It’s giving you a command. It’s a verb.  Measure the perimeter.  Okay, you’re gonna measure the perimeter and I’m writing this.  Now, we don’t do that, please.  When I say active listening, guess who’s doing active watching?",1
"Teacher.  So you need to be looking here.  Here’s your directions.  You’re going to measure the perimeter of the rectangle that you have.  Okay?  After you measure, you have to find the perimeter.  And how do we find the perimeter?  How do we find the perimeter after we’ve measured?  Very easy.",0
"Yeah, I know you need help.  I’ll be right there.  Let’s – let’s do – here’s my – I want to see some nice work going on here.  Student E, Student A, you’re all right? [Speaking foreign language]  Guys, I need a little space here.",0
"You should put it on your sentence.  You’re showing me how you got it.  That’s different, okay?  Get your yarn – can you get – Student M, get the scissors over there.  You guys doing okay?  Student R, nice, you’re helping nice.  Student R, this looks beautiful. Now you need to do the other part.  Now find the perimeter. Show me how you find it.  I want to see it.  No, on this table over here.  This is where we’re gonna do the measuring, okay?  That’s – oh, you guys are really doing a super job.  That’s enough.  You don’t need any more.",1
"Student S, you want to go?  We’ll work on this together, all right?  Student S, can you put this in your desk?  You did a nice job.  I will be putting I’m sure a nice sticker on there.  Yeah, she should go.  Tell Mrs. F. I just kept her a little bit, all right?  Can you pick up that off the floor?",0
"When you’re ready to cut, I’d like to check.  You’re all set? Now go and measure the yarn that you want.  Do I have all the colors there for you?  Try to do good self control, okay?  You need to do that.  Go ahead.",1
"I also see the word ear and in, but I don’t want you to worry about that.  I want you to think about line.  So linear – Student M, could I have your attention here?  Remember it’s active listening.  Thank you.  We’re going to be measuring things on a line, okay?  So – and I’m gonna show you what we’re gonna be doing on that.  We’re gonna be working with – what word did we learn, that we know?",1
"And a rectangle – what can you see – what can you see about a rectangle?  If you were to describe it – somebody raise their hand, let me call on you.  Let’s not all talk out. Go ahead, Student A.  What do you see about a rectangle? What can you say if you were describing?  It’s a what?",0
"Excuse me, listen.  The ant – the ant starts – and I love the ant, how you say ant in Cape Verdean Creole, right? Fruminga.",0
"She can’t say?  Oh, that’s nice of you to let her see, but I want you to turn to the person and you’re gonna say this in a whisper.  Listen what you’re gonna say.  Perimeter is the distance around.  Put it in your head.  When you think perimeter, think of distance around.  One person at a time, you’re gonna tell each other that.  Go ahead.",1
A figure.  You all said it?  You ready?  Shh.  Did you finish? Did everybody get a chance to say it?,0
"Okay, he’s saying if it was 3/6 it would be 1/2; however, 3 is less than half of the number 7, so it would go over here. So 3/7.  So we need to remember the relationship between the numerator and the denominator is going to let us know on which side of ½ we should put it.  Is this coming back to anybody now?  [Writing on board]. And Mrs. H is going to do a number line with you.  We’re going to order some fractions on the number line, and then, again, like we did last week, we’re going to split up into groups. I’m going to give you a number line.  I have two sets of cards, they’re in different colors, there’s two sets in this bag, okay?  You can start with the smaller set and then work your way to the bigger set.  You’re going to have some paper to do some math on, and just like we did last week, we’re going to place the cards on our number line. Student H, will you please get me the tape from the back table? So these are the things we want to keep in mind.  And here’s our objective, can you guys read this today?",0
"Student D, can you put that away for me please?  Okay, there’s my zero.  Student S?",0
"Okay, and 16 is less than 18.  You guys did an excellent job. Everybody give yourselves a pat on the back, that was fantastic, excellent. So now we’re going to split up into groups of 3.  So I’m going to have – last week we had 8 people from Mrs. F’s group work with another 8 people, do you remember who you paired up with?  We’re going to get into those same groups, and then I’m going to place a third person with each of those groups.  So I just want you to stand in clusters, because I think we’re going to use the desks to do this one.  So push the chairs in.  Student C, why don’t you stand up for a minute.  So Student H, who did you work with, Honey?  Okay, so you three girls can stand over here for a minute.  And then Student T, who did you work with?",1
"Okay, I’m going to have Student D, Student D and Student S are going to work as a group, so can you help me with that? Give everybody one of these, one baggie, and two of those, thank you, Student C. Student K, who were your partners?",0
"So let’s see how we do.  If you want a set of cubes for the mixed fraction that you have, or the improper fraction that you have, just take one set, that’s all you need, one set of cubes. If each group wants to go get one set of cubes so that when you get to your improper fraction – one person from each group. Ladies and gentlemen, you only need one set. I want you over here so we can all see, so let’s turn your desk that way, and turn Student S this way, and Mrs. H is going to sit in the middle.",1
"I’m sorry, I interrupted you, polite disagreement and… Do you remember what else we discussed?  Maybe Student D your partner can help you.  Ladies, I’d like you to pay attention for a moment.  [Rings bell]  Polite disagreement, polite discussion…",0
"Bugs talking, right, little whispers, not full voice.  Okay, go back to your work. Where is our number line?  So here’s our number line, and I see somebody’s already gone ahead and labeled it, good job.  So we’re going to use the blue cards first.  Wait a minute, one second, we’re just going to spread’m out.  Let’s see, Student S, why don’t you come stand behind these two and you can look from here.",0
I didn't.  You don’t need your chair.  Just stand up.  You’re going to come back and sit in your seat.  So pick a fraction.  Does everybody agree with Student S that that’s where ½ goes?,1
"Student C can show you.  Sit down please, Student S.  Okay, let’s see what we have.  I see two fractions that are not in correct order.  I’m going to pull them out for you. This one and this one.  So this is an improper fraction. Remember what we did yesterday with the bags and the cubes. So how many will come in a whole set?",0
"Five, because that’s how many equals a whole set, okay?  Please do not get out of your seat.  If you need me, what should we do?",0
"All right, come help Student M.  Scooch in, Student S, and help Student M.  She needs help.  Use the cubes. How did we do?  Nice job, you did both sides?",0
"3/8 is still not in the correct place.  So what strategy can you use to decide?  Use a strategy. [Rings bell]  I am waiting for one group to finish up, so what I am going to ask you to do quietly, Student L and K, are you ready to listen, I’m going to ask you to please put everything back inside, put all the fraction pads back inside the baggy.  Excuse me, Mrs.  H’s class, have I finished giving my directions, Student D?",1
"Sit down please and wait for the entire direction.  You’re going to put your cards back inside the bag, please.  Then you’re going to take your bag, your number line, and you’re going to place them on the back rectangle table along with if you chose to take a chalkboard.  Then you’re going to quickly resume your seat, and we’re going to wrap up our lesson today.  Okay?  There you go.  Do it as fast as you can, please, as quietly… We don’t need to fight.  Student C, can you put those [inaudible] for me. Did you figure out where to place it?",1
"Student C, Student T said that more than one whole would be easy to find, who agrees with that?  Can you guys put your pencils down please and listen to Mrs. H?  Student T is saying that the next one we should look for is more than one whole because it’s easy to find.  Raise your hand if you agree that more than one whole is going to be easy to find?  Why, Student B?",0
Okay can I have all eyes on calendar and Student R and Student D are going to lead calendar for us.  Go ahead.  Today is? fourteenth day of school.,0
"The number line.  It’s going to help us order our fractions on our number line.  When you go back to your seats, you’re going back to your group.  We may have to change a few people for groups.  We’ll see, because we have people absent today.  First go to where your desk is.  Not yet. Not until I say go.  Then I am going to pass out manipulatives.  Student K said we’re doing manipulatives this morning.",1
"How many in all – the whole.  Excellent.  All right, I would like the ladies to stand and go back.  Thank you.  And then I would like the gentlemen to go back.  So you’re going to where your seat is and I’m going to see if I need to change anybody’s seat.",1
"All right, eyes up for a minute.  Before I give you the manipulatives, I want to use the ones on the board and make sure everybody knows what they’re doing.  So everybody sitting up nice and straight, paying attention.  I want to talk about one half first.  I’m gonna pretend these are my pizzas and I’m gonna take one half of the pizza.  I want to know what else is equivalent to one half.  I would like Student J come up and see if he can make one half with thirds.  He is going to go to the pizza that is divided into three equal parts and he is going to see if he can make one half – an equivalent fraction into the one half. All right, I want you to put it on top and see if it works or you can try to piece it together and see if you can make a whole pizza.  All right, were you able to make an equivalent fraction with thirds?",1
"I made two charts.  One of the charts has circles, and that’s with people using the pizza.  One of the charts you have to use squares to represent your fractions.  You’re going to tell the fraction, you’re going to draw it.  If you would prefer to use the squares instead of the circles, that’s fine, but you just have to relate it to your circles.  But I can give you both and your group can decide what they want to use.  I think it is easier when you’re working with the pizza to use the circles.  I think it’s easier if you’re working with the bars to use the bars.  But your group can talk about it and make the decision.  If I call you, you’re coming to the back table and you were taking the manipulatives for your group.  Can I have Student A come to the back table.",0
"You’re going to bring this back for your group.  Can I have Student K.  Can I have Student N.  Can I have Student M. So I’ve called all those groups.  All right now I want you to go into the box and I want you to find one half because you’re going to do one half again.  So everyone find one half.  Student M can I have you come up and put all these back, honey?  I want every group to do it by themselves now.",1
"So you are going to now write down all the fractions you found for one half and you’re going to draw it.  And you’re doing the same thing for one fourth.  Okay, how did we do for one half?  Where are all your equivalent fractions for one half?  Do you want to – it would be easier, though, if you worked with all the same pieces, honey.  Use all sixteenths because you want to be able to tell me how many sixteenths. One half is equivalent to how many twelfths?  So all the sixteenths.  There are definitely more.  I’m giving this group the circle ones to go with these and you have to write down all your fractions that are equivalent to one half.  Look at me, Student N, all the fractions equivalent to one half and draw a picture for each one.",0
"I’m coming over to you, Student N.  Hold on.",1
"So you should be telling me all equivalent fractions for one half.  Can I have eyes up?  Everybody freeze.  Student J, freeze.  Student A sit so Student J can see.  In the first box you have one half and you have one half shaded.  What’s the next equivalent fraction, Student K?",1
"Yes.  Try it.  Try the sixths.  That’s a nine, honey, holding it that way.  Okay can everybody look at Student I’s. Okay, I need the group to freeze.  I want you to look at Student I’s.  Student I said one fourth is equivalent to two eights and he is going to prove it to you.  You put the two eighths on top and did it work, Student N?  Did it work?  Yes.  So everybody is going to write two eights on their chart and we’re not going to do eighths again because Student I already did it.",0
"Which one, honey?  You just fill what you can fill on the chart, that’s all.  Then that’s it.  Then go to the next one.  Okay, can I have eyes up?  Eyes up.  Two minutes. Make sure you have equivalent fractions for each one that I gave you.  Two minutes and then we’re going to try the number line.  So two minutes.",0
"As soon as you are ready put your heads down so I’ll know who’s ready.  If your group is ready you should have your head down so I know.  Could I have Student N put the pieces on the back table, please.  Could I have Student M – were you in charge of that group?",0
Yes?  We have time to do one.  I am going to give each group a fraction.  You are to start ordering them from least to greatest.  You’re working together as a group.  You only have eight cards between your group so you’re working cooperatively.  You have two minutes to order them least to greatest.  Use your equivalent fractions to help you.,0
"See, I wish you would have just stuck to what I said to do and not put all this crazy stuff in here.  Okay.  I can't see. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  Let's say 10 from the sink to the stove.  About 10 feet.  Wait a minute.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5. From the stove to the refrigerator – I said sink to stove 10.  You're not paying attention.  Did you add them up?",1
"Sit down please.  Now how many 12s can you get out of there? Remember, it's 12 inches.  You're trying to change it. You've got 25 inches.  You're going to change those.",0
Ten.  Okay.  Speak loudly so I can hear.,1
Keep it in [inaudible] and then grab another notebook. All right.  So what number do we have?,0
"Eight tenths would be – and 1 up here is a whole number, so we can simplify a whole number.  So we start at zero and we go to one.  Okay.  Experiment time.  Please open up your student journals to Page 44.  Okay.  One, two, three eyes on me.",0
"You're either writing letter up or letter down in that blank at the top where it says ""make a guess.""  Your prediction. This is an independent prediction.  Okay.  Here's how this is gonna work.  Everybody has a cup, you're gonna work with a partner.  You and your partner are gonna have one cup and you are going to have ten letter tiles, Student D.  You have ten letter tiles.  You're gonna shake it and then very carefully, Student L, drop it.  Watch how I did that again 'cause I don't want these letter tiles going all over the place because they are Ms. W's and we don't want to lose them.  You shake it and I would count.",1
"Yeah.  Here's your Post-it for what fraction lands letter down. So when you get to the end, you gotta [inaudible].  Here's your Post-it for which fraction lands letter down.  So you're gonna add these up at the end and write the fraction.  Okay.  I don't wanna see this anymore.  Take it [inaudible].",1
"When you get to the end, you're gonna total, you're gonna add all these up and write that number out of 100.  You girls need to be at your desks please.  I'm not sure why you're walking around.  Have a seat.  Okay.  This – okay, this Post-it when you get done with the total, you're gonna add all your total down and write that number on here out of 100.  When you get to the end you're gonna add the total down and write that number and write it out of 100.  You're gonna add them up and then write this number on the Post- it.",1
"Well, why don't you work together then.  It should not be taking this long.  [Inaudible].  You write down the same numbers each time.  How many up?",0
"I only had about 50 percent participation that time.  1, 2, 3, eyes on me.",0
"Thank you for your eyes.  Right now, on your Post-it, you should have a fraction.  Out of 100 tosses, how many landed letter down.  So Student I's total for the total down was what Student I?",0
"Yeah, but you need to listen to what he says first, so you should be sitting in slant.  Slant means that you should be listening to what your neighbors have to say.",1
"Hold on, hold on.",0
"Sit down.  Stay here.  Do your work here.  Sit down.  Sit.  Sit down here.  I am not playing with you now.  This is a quiet table.  If you are working, you are working with me.  Last warning.  I'm sorry.  We can't take any snack until this is finished.  Did you hear what I said?  I'm going to take it now and put it in the garbage.  I'm going to put it here.",0
"I'm not going to take it.  Student A, let's go.  This is the first time you're doing math very well.  Good job.  If you finish this page, I'll give you a cracker.  When you finish.  Can you stop throwing that?  Give it to me.  Thank you.  Do your math.  Let me have it.  Give it to me.  Thank you.  Sit down.  Show me how you can do it.  Look at this. You were the one that was telling me the answers.  How did they get to 300?",0
"They break the numbers up by – tell us exactly what happened here.  Can you stop please?  Let's go.  Student A, I need you to finish your work.  Write the numbers fully here. Let's see what it is.  Okay.  Look at what you have here. You have 300, and that's 3.  Can you sit down please? Student A you said 1 plus 1 plus 0 plus 0 would give you 300?",0
"I understand what you said to me, that 100 plus 200, but you're not representing it.  Student A, please.  Can you sit down? You're not representing it well because you said 1 plus 1 plus 0 is going to give me 1.  2 plus 0 plus 0 is going to give me 2.  What you write in here that is the hundreds, I don't see the need for this here.  What is the value of 2 here?  Student A, what is the value of 2 here?",0
Add it up and see what happens.  Did you see 300 here?  Is that what they did?  [Inaudible].  I wonder if you [inaudible]. Can you stop?  How did it get us to here?  What is the value of 4 here?,0
"Add it up and see.  What's your question?  Student A, can you please stop?  Stop.  Because you have started paying attention – what is that?  You don't eat peanuts?",1
"Student A, sit down and stop fooling around, please.  Let me have it.  Everybody knows that math class is never like this in the classroom.  It's time to [inaudible].  Are you done?  The people are going to watch you and see what you do.  Student T, can you please do your math?  I know you can do it.  When you break the numbers up by breaking ones, then the tens – okay.  [Inaudible].  Sit down, Student A. Come right here.  Sit down.  Sit here with me.  Listen. Sit down.  Student A, [inaudible].  Where does the 60 come from?  What and what?  How did they get 60 here?  Can you stop, Student A?  How did I get 60 here?  What did I do?",1
You've got to write it down.  You can't be stretching your hand from here to here.  Can you stop?  I see what you're doing. Now it says here where does the 11 come from?,0
"700.  Stop calling out.  I would like you to raise up your hand.  96 – sit down.  Turn around and sit down, please. Turn around and sit down properly.  [Inaudible].  Sit down properly please.  Pick up your book.  Solve this math.",0
"Write it here.  11 is from here, right?  11 is got by adding. The [inaudible] question.  Solution two was – it says here – look here.  How do you explain – stop.  You don't just sit down and look at them.  Let them stop fighting, please.",0
"Let me see what you did here.  We're looking right here.  How did they get to 1 here?  Stop yelling.  What did they do? 6 plus 5 is 11.  If 6 plus 5 is 11, why didn't they write 11 here?  What happened?",0
"Because it's in the tens?  Put it down.  What do you tell me now?  Sit down.  Student T, let me see what you did.  Get 7 cards at a time.  Is this 7 or 5?  5 cards.  Can you sit down please?  I want you to finish.  Just help me with the cards please.  Are you done?  Bring out the card.  You play with me.  It's not 7 cards.  It's 5.  See what is done. Hold them.  What you need to do is this.",1
"No.  That's not how to do it.  Everybody stop.  Let's read at the same time.  Come to play.  Come to this side.  When you do the first one – come right here.  Everyone's playing. Okay.  Student T, move over here.  Give me the whole card. Stop whistling please.  You have used it two times.",0
"You used bathroom in the morning.  Then when we sat at math, you told me you needed to use bathroom, and I allowed you to go.  So how did I lie?  Sit down please.  Student J, where is your math?  Stop.  Get your math book.  We are here now.  When we play we cannot have – look at the game. Can you go over there and get the pencil please?  Student J, can you go get a pencil?  When we finish this round one, round two you get your snack.",1
"No you didn't.  Look at how this game goes.  Your mom is going to witness that.  You know that?  Look.  We're going to play close to 1,000.  In this game each student gets 7 cards.  You're going to use 6 cards out of them to form your number.  For example, I am the student.  Can you pay attention please?  I am the student that is going to play. I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  This is the card that is dealt to me.  I'm going to change the [inaudible] cards.  Okay. I'm going to show you also how to use the wild card.  All eyes on Ms. I please.  I have these numbers.  I'm trying to win my opponent.  I'm going to win my opponent by making two numbers that are together to get a number very close to 1,000.",0
I'm not seeing anything productive.You know how to play this game.I've played it with you before.[Inaudible].You're not fighting with it.Can you leave him alone and do your work?We're not going to lunch until our math is done.After we complete our math as we do as a class – I'm listening to you.,1
"1,100.I'm listening to you.I'm going to tell your mom.You're yelling at me.You've been fooling around.",0
"Stop.  Don't do that.  [Inaudible].  Let me see what you've done.  We want the number to be very close to 1,000.  Try again.  7 cards.  What are you doing with the table when we are doing math?  I'm not going to talk over anybody.  Until this class is done, we can't move anywhere.  Put that one away.  3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  Put it away.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Are you done with this?  You can use a wild card.  You can turn it into another number you like.  Leave that deck alone.  Come sit down.  Finish your math.  Spread your cards.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  Where is it?  Get another chair.  That would be too much.  Do this one.  Hold on.  Do this to be 9.  Stop.  Can you stop?  Do this to be – hold on.  This could be a – this is 10.  This could be a 5.",0
Stop.  Sit down.,0
"I don't think your mom would like to see you acting this way during this lesson.  Thank you, Student D.  You have been participating.  I don’t want to divert your attention. Thank you Student T.  Thank you, Student A.  Good job. There's something you said here that's really – you added the 6 out of 5.",1
1 plus 9 is 8.  Plus 1 you borrowed from me is 10.  Sit down now.  Sit down right now.  You have a choice to go outside to the [inaudible].,0
"The ones.  Good job.  So you're saying that 6 plus 5 is going to give you 11, and we're left with 9 and 2.  What does 9 – sorry.  Sit down.  Student D, you're still distracting us. Can you please turn around and sit down?",1
"Go back to your seat please.  Sit down.  Thank you.  Student D, what does 9 here mean to you?",0
Good job.  What is the value of 2 here?  20.  90 plus – I want to remind you that there is a camera here watching you.  I have here 90 plus 10 is what?  Student T?,0
"This will give us 821.  This is [inaudible] of this math. Another way we can solve the math using the traditional algorithm is this.  We're going to do 196 plus 625.  Okay. Get away from there, please.  Can you leave the computer please?  Pay attention.  Thank you.  6 plus 5 is what?  11.",0
"Allow him to talk.  Look up here.  The classroom respects adults and classmates.  Can you give him the respect?  Sit down, Student D.  I'm listening to you, Student A.  Student A, I'm listening.  You were saying something about 9 and 2. Student S, can you tell me how we get 110?",1
"Which is 700.  Now when we add it up we're going to get [inaudible], this at a tens, and this at hundreds, what we had here was we had 100, nine 10s, six 1s.  Can you stop, Student A?  Then we have in the 600s column – maybe your dad is going to see how you do in the classroom.  I have the 2 in the tens, and I have the 5 in the ones.  When I add it up, I am going to add 5 ones plus 6 ones is going to give me what?",0
"Sit down, Student A.  Student A, come and sit here.  I'm going to work with you.  I'm giving you a choice.  Sit down here. Can you leave my seat please?  I'll work with you. Student A, I'm not playing with you.  Let's go.  Can you read this to me?  You're right here.",0
"Right here.  Stop fooling around please.  I want you to sit here.  You can get that chair if you want to.  Let's go. You don't have to do this [inaudible].  Can you move a little bit please?  Actually, we're going to move over there.  What are you doing?  Okay.  Let's go.  Write your name.  Somebody sit here.  Turn this way.  Okay.  Student A, what are you doing with pencils?",0
"Turn around please.  Student T, come over here.  What is the problem?",0
Who told you?  You're blocking Student D.  You can't be seen by the camera.  That's cool.  Now look carefully at these two different – [inaudible] honey.  It's not your—,1
"Did you know that everything you've been yelling is recorded? You know this math.  I don't know why it is a problem. Let's go.  Solve the math.  It said how would you explain to someone else how solution one works.  Explain to Ms. A how solution one works.  Tell me.  Student T, how does solution one work?  Put it away.  Let's go.  That's not what you're doing now.  You know what?  I'm giving everybody a choice.  If this math is not done, we're not going out for recess.  Do your math.  You know what to do. Leave him.  Camera is covering every place in the classroom, everywhere.  The camera is seeing everywhere. That's not what we're talking about.  Let's do this.",1
"Yes.  You have a very good start.  Did you finish?  Let's finish this one first.  How would you explain to someone else how solution one works?  Where does the [inaudible] here come from?  Get away from there.  Come right here. Your mom did not sign it.  What is the problem with the camera?  You know how to do math.  Where does the [inaudible] come from?  Continue.  Finish your work. Student A, I'm not playing now.  Stop.  Turn around.  You can do it.  You are a wonderful mathematician.  Don’t worry.  Get down from there now.  Continue.  If you cannot concentrate and do your math – it's what we're working on today.  Let's do this math, please.  You know what to do. Try and do this math.  I will show you.  Let me see people that are working hard, what I can give to them.  If you throw that at him, you are going out.  People that are working hard, I'm going to go around and give them something.  Who is working hard?  Is Student D working? Come in here.  I'm visiting Student D.  Student D, you're not supposed to be here.  You're here.  Sit down.  Turn around.  I'm going to give you because you're working hard.",1
"No because it would cost more than $2.00.  So that's telling me that I could not have all three.  I may have to have two, decide on which do I want because it's gonna cost more than a $1.00.  Now we are gonna look at some more estimates of how we – because on our test, we got a lot of questions where – I need everybody's attention.  Everybody's attention, Child N.  We have figures where we have to round before we can find the estimates.  So we are going to look at how we estimate these prices.  So let's read ahead in here.  [Another word].  Shhh.  Give me five.  Give me five. Give thank you and turn.  Thank you, Student J.  Thank you, Student N.  Thank you, Student V.  Give me five means all your attention.  You cannot do both things at the same time, Student J.  You cannot learn math and draw at the same time.  Let me do this.  When you get your worksheet, you have your chance to do yours.  Pay attention.  Now estimating sums and differences.  Sums is the answer when we do what?",1
Subtract.  So we are going to look at – you notice it's giving both.  So we're gonna look at how we arrive at these.  So it says round to the greatest value to get numbers you can add or subtract easy.  So I'm gonna do this.  I need everybody's attention.  You're not going to work here. You're gonna pay attention to what I'm doing.  So let's read the first one.  It says estimate $5.78 plus $3.19.,0
"Hmm?  And if we look it says – the problem reads $5.78 is rounded up to $6.00.  Is there – it's rounded to $6.00. Let me ask once more for everybody to pay attention.  I need everybody to pay attention.  Thank you.  This is important.  You get this not only in a test, but you're supposed to have knowledge of rounding so that when you go out to spend your money, you can have an idea how much this thing costs, can I afford it?",1
"– 40.  47, we identify place value, and we round, we look to the right.  Very good.  50.  Now we add.  Zero.  Why are we yelling?  We don't need to.  No, I need Student R, can you come and do – no, you're not – you because we need to be just – very good.  Student T, please come and try number two for us.  Number two.  So Student T is gonna do number two.  68, write it Student T.  Write it a little further down so that doesn't look so close to this.  68 plus 13. No, not that way.  Write just as though I have it on the board so that you can round it first.",1
"Very good.  Student T, focus.  Student K, focus.  Let's be kind.  Let's be kind.  Let's be kind.  Let me.  So what's the estimate of – sorry, we're subtracting.  Remember, we're subtracting.  What's this difference?  The estimated difference is?  What's the estimated difference?  What is the estimated difference?  Come on, students.  The estimated difference between 6 and 40 is – 6 and 20 is?",0
"– to do that one.  To do number five.  Come over here, both of you, you're gonna do number five.  We're getting to be too noisy.  And we're playing over here.  Student J, turn around for me, please.  Turn around, Student J.  Turn around.  Turn around, Student J.  Thank you.  It's work time.",0
You work by yourself.  Do the one that we haven't done yet.  So do number five.  Why aren't we getting.  I know you're working here.  Sit right here.  Sit here.  Sit here first.,0
"No, he doesn't want anybody to work with him, so he'll work [to get].  Both of you work together.  Who would like to work with Student H?  Who would like to work with Student H? Student C, I'll work with you.  Come Student C, I'll work with you.  Well, no one wants to work with you.  No you can't with all three.  So many of you can't work.  Work with these three.  Listen.  Shhh.  Listen.  No, let him stay with the paper.  Guys, I don't think I see work going on here.  Take that out of your mouth.",0
Take that out of your mouth.,0
"No, you'll still keep your paper, but you're working and making sure you're checking your work together.  You'll still keep your paper.  So do number four.  Number four.  I'm gonna tell you the ones that you're doing.  Student G, you're still working together but you're in a little group.  So number four.  [Inaudible].  Please sit.  This is math.  So it doesn't matter.  We're just working to get support from each other.  Are we working here or are we just having a discussion?",1
"So let's – remember you have to round the figure first beside it.  Sit properly, Student V.  Do number four.  I've already done these.  We have already done these.  So we need to start from number four.",1
"No, we're putting a little speed in it.  This group is not supposed to be communicating with this group.",1
"So you start at number four.  Start at number four.  Student V, sit down at your chair, darling.  Start on number four. Come number four.",0
"You know do number four first, and then I'll do that.  You need to sit here.  It doesn't matter.  You sit here and do your paper.  That's the chair and get the paper done.  I don't want you walking around, Student H.  Sit here and get it done.",0
"So it's rounded to $6.00.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I'm showing Student C something here.  Girls, Student C – not Student C.  Student T, I need to see you working on the paper.  Leave the talking until recess.",0
"$3.00.  She's still talking.  No, that's not the math you were talking to – [a while] talking about.  I know when you're talking math.",1
$9.00.  Remember to put back your decimal point and your dollar sign.  So what is the answer for number four?  Raise your hands.  Number four.  What's the sum for number four?,0
"Sum.  No.  When he comes back, he has a pass.  Student J has a pass.  Next.  Next.  Go onto the next one.  677 rounded to the nearest hundred.  Look for the hundred column, move – look at the right and what's the next number so we know if we're to round up or down.  677 rounded to the nearest hundred becomes what?  677 to the nearest hundred, what does that become?  If you round 677 – no, no.  I'm talking about rounding the numbers first.  Round this to the nearest hundred.  The nearest hundred.  The nearest hundred, Student N.  Not the nearest ten, the nearest hundred.  677 rounded to the nearest hundred.",1
"Student T?  We round down because it's less than five. Remember, if it's less than five, we round down.  So round your number first.  So let's start because some students are working well.  Other [inaudible] having a bit of difficulty.  Let us just go over the stuff for rounding. Rounding.  Identify the place value and then you round.  If you're working with money means you're gonna round to the nearest dollar.  If you're working with –",1
"Let's see since I passed if there is any difference here. Student N.  Student N, I passed by and you still haven't done anything since I passed by.",0
"52 is rounded to 60, Student N?  Student N, is 52 rounded to 60?  Pay attention to your work.  See, you're not paying attention.  And she's [dealing] with you not able to see that is incorrect because she needs to be pay attention also.  So 50 take away 40 does not equal 20.  That's what you call focus on what you're doing.  Give me five.  Give me five.  Give me five.  Give me five.  I see Student A's head up.  This group hand is up.  I want the other two groups to be ready.  Thank you, Student J.  Thank you, Student D.  Waiting on the girls.  What have we learned about rounding?  What have we reviewed about rounding? Let's wrap up.  What have learned or reviewed about rounding?  Student A, tell me something you learned about rounding or remember about rounding from this lesson.",1
"No, we don't look left or right.  We do what?  Sit down.",0
I need all eyes on me.  All eyes on me.,0
"Look at the number.  Look at the number.  You okay, Student S. Hands.  Hands so that we can hear each other clearly. First, we look at the number.  What place value are we rounding to?",1
"That doesn't sound like you're ready for math.  Good morning, boys and girls.",0
"Now we're gonna do our – we're ready for our math lesson this morning, and I need everybody to give me their attention. We are preparing for our final test, remember.  So we have to pay attention and make sure we get whatever we are reviewing.  If I do something that you do not understand, raise your hand to ask a question.  There's no need for you to be putting your hand up or doing things like that.  Just be normal.  Just as though as you would've acted in normal class.  Thank you very much.  So yesterday we had an objective, and we were looking at how we estimate sums.  So we're gonna continue in that lesson this morning.  And we estimate by using what we know about a value.  So this morning we're going to continue by looking at whole numbers.  So I'm gonna give you a die and I'm gonna give you a die and I'm gonna give you another die.  And so I want the three of you who have the die to come up.  Roll your die.  So Student V has – come up Student V and show what you have on your die, what number you have.",1
"To the right.  So that's the next step.  We look to the right of the number.  I need everybody's attention.  No writing yet.  No, I'll give you a chance, a page to practice that. Just pay attention.  What is the number?",1
"I don't know.  Figure it out, and then tell me.  Don't talk. Figure it out.  Compare.  If you turn your figure horizontal versus if you turn figure vertically, is it the same?",0
"And you get the same volume.  Let's see.  What conclusion did you come up with?  Raise your hand.  What conclusion did you and your partner come up with, Student S?",0
Let's see.  Those shouldn't be in your desk.  And you shouldn't be opening these up.  Those should be closed up.,0
"Not yet.  Not yet, please.  Hold up your figures when you are finished.  Very good.  You have created a what?",0
"No.  Raise your hands.  Say that again, Student J.",0
Don't call it out.  The directions say each of the figures below is made up of cubic boxes which measure 1 unit on each side.  Find the volume of each figure.  Take a look at that and find the volume for number 1.  This isn't on the screen.  We're doing number 1.  Remember it is volume is length times width times height.  So volume equal is – equals length times width times height.  So for the first one our length is going to be what?,0
Nope.  Raise your hand.  Student C?,0
"Shhh.  And when you finish, hold it up so I can see that you have created a rectangle with a length of 4 and a width of 2.  What would our units be?  Raise your hand.  What would our units be for this area of a rectangle, Student S?",0
"What was your question? 3, 2 and 1. So what you’re going to do now is you’re giving your book to somebody else and have them answer one or two of your questions in the time that you have.  So now move around, give your book to somebody else.  Do you have the question in your book? [Lots of noise and talking between all the kids]",0
"So the price decreased by 2,000.  Okay. So the last thing I wanted to take a look at is page 152.  Let’s go over what we’ve learned so far about our graphs.  Page 152 in our hardback book.  Page 152 we see in our hardback, Student A, you may go down to Miss J’s room and relax. Take a cool-out.  So let’s take a look at page 152.  Raise your hand if you’re not on page 152.  We’ve come to the end of Chapter 4 dealing with tables and graphs.  So let’s take a look on 152.  We have our review.  So we learned about tables.  Student E at the top after it says “interpret a table.”",0
"No, just in the week that we use the data was the week that Thursday was the slowest, and Wednesday the most bikes were sold. So we have a table.  Now how are we going to use it? We learned that our next place we’re going to use a table and how is it organized.  What’s one way, at the bottom, how this table is organized, Student X? Can someone help Student X out? I’m making sure everyone is paying attention.  I can tell when you’re not paying attention.  Could someone help out with explaining this table.  What do we see? What are the characteristics of this table?",0
"I’m sorry, turn to page 85 in your workbook, and I want you to practice …  Page 85, page 85, in your workbook.  Get your workbook out, let’s go.  Page 85. Do you want to call your mom and go home? Do you need to go home? Head down to the nurse and have them call your mom, go home. Page 85.  On your desk, page 85, I want to come by and see how we’re doing with…   You want to first study the graph.  Make sure your name is at the page and today is Monday, January 10th. It doesn’t matter, I want the work done.  Page 85.  Page 85.  I want the work done.  Page 85. Once you have it done, take it out of your book.  Make sure your name is on the top, date.  Leave it right there at the desk. Get your Just Right book out and quietly wait for everybody to finish. I’m collecting them, take them out of your book.  Do you have a homework sheet? I passed homework sheets out on the table. Get a homework sheet, put your name and today’s date. [Thank you] for the table that’s not talking. Do you have your name on your homework sheet? Name, and put the date. I’ll collect them, you can set them right there.  Make sure you have your name on your homework sheet.",0
Right there.  I need people to keep track of your stuff. There’s a social studies book back there.,1
"It stops at the same time, it took the same amount of time. It’s equal.  We see that it both took 8… Oh, table 1, table 2, 3.  You guys have gotta work on some goals for yourselves. So what it means is at point 3 and point 4, that it was at the same time.  So now we want to be able to turn back to page 79.  Last week, is there anyone who did not finish page 79, and finish that information? Page 79? Raise your hand.  Let’s go through. So begin reading at the top for us, Student X, on page 79 in our workbook.  Student M.  We’re going to go over it.  There are some people who did because they’d finished up when we were working with partners, and there are some people who didn’t. Miss W, could you take the paperclip from table 2 please? Thank you. Okay, Student X.",0
Let's see.  Excuse me.  Move away from my door.  You can come here until I'm done.  Go on to part b.  You should have your sentence.  What your sentence should say—,0
"0.25 and 0.4.  So any number between those two could be the answer.  Now let me see what you do.  Okay.  Check it again.  Make sure you have the right answer.  In between. Come on, honey.  Stop rocking your chair.  It is?  We'll take care of it later.  Okay.  Where's your work?",0
"Okay.  Where's yours?  What about two sixths and all of those numbers?  Until you reach 0.4.  You're not adding.  In between.  Any number that comes in between.  Nice.  Some people are using their number lines.  Very good.  I was watching to see who was going to use the number line.  Let me see yours.  Good job.  Good.  Let me see yours, Student E.  All right, Student S.  Let me see.  Okay.  All right, Student M.  Where's yours?  Anything in between, in order. You can go in order, yes.  Got it, Student C?  Okay.  All right.  We'll work on it.  Anything in between.  Give me your pencil.  We are going to start at what?  What's your question?  In between the smallest number – excuse me, pay attention – 5 to 0.4.  What do you need in between to get up to this 0.4?  Student C, you've got it.  Okay.  Now let me read the problem for you again.  At the zoo Susie walked 0.25 of a mile and Felix walked 0.4 of a mile.  Who walked the longest distance?  Student M, who walked the longest distance here?",0
One fifth – I need your attention.  One fifth is—,0
"Yes.  You can write in your math journal.  No problem.  All right.  As soon as you get your paper you can start. Sorry.  One for you.  Now this one is a little different. Let us read part A first, and then see what we are going to do.  Student S, pay attention please.  Now this is Ms. Hendricks asked her students how they get to school each day.  She collected their answers and determined the following results.",0
"100 percent.  So 100 minus 70 is equal to 30 percent.  Student E, I need your attention.",0
"Wow, good for you, Student S.  Did you all see that thinking behind it?  Awesome.  All right, now that we have reviewed finding fractions of a number, we are going to work on finding fractional parts that are equal to 1 using a rectangular area.  So today I want to be able to use maybe the array of 4 times 6.  Student C, you're in charge of my lights today.  Student T, I might ask you to move.  Can you excuse us?  Can you go and maybe sit over there for a little bit, 'cause I don't want to keep this blowing on you, okay?  Just push your chair in.",1
"You're all talking at once.  What did I say whenever you have a number, both numbers have zero in it?  What can I do to make it easier?",0
"And now I add, plus.  [Speaking French]  Put your pencil on your desk.  Do not touch it.  Right now you are focusing on me.  Okay, what is the next step that I do?  Someone else. Student L.",0
"No, hers is a different array.  You all have different arrays. In your small groups you are going to decide how you want to split it.  Discuss it with your group.  All right. Student K's group, Student K, you have Student R, Student L, Student J and Student M.  Do not move yet until I ask everyone to go to their spot.  And Student K's group, you are going – actually you can use my markers.  They're different colors.  Student K's group will be here.",1
"Student W's group, you have a 5 by 12 array.  You have Student W, Student A, Student A and Student D.  You will be here. Student S's group C, Student S and Student R, Student D, Student D, Student N, Student D and Student D.  Group B is going to go Student A, Student D, Student C, Student M, Student M, Student N.  And then Group E is with me.  You're going to work together quietly, but everyone will have a chance to share.  [Speaking French]  All right.  When I ask you to stand up, you are going to stand up.  Push your chairs in.  You don’t need a pencil because you have overhead markers to work with.  All you do is move your body, but try not to knock over my camera.  You may all stand up quietly.  Walk over to your group.  Be careful with the camera.",1
You may move your chair and you may begin.,0
"Excellent.  Remember to take off the sticky note.  You don't need it.  Just put it on the table.  Okay, the first one, I need to find a better marker for you.",1
Go back to your seat.,0
Please hold onto your paper until I call you.  Go back to your seat quickly.  Be careful with the camera.,0
"Okay, can I have this on, my light person?  Okay.  Which group would like to share?  Just raise your hand first.  Okay, Student A's group, come on up.  And if we have time, we have about 10 minutes, maybe everyone will have a chance to share, because in my group we didn't come up with one whole and I want you to help us in that group.  Where did we go wrong?  Okay, Student S's group, why don't we do this? You're only going to share little by little, so whichever part you're sharing will be done on that.  You show for now, okay.",1
"Okay, Student S, do me a favor.  Look up so you see where you are at.  So what should you do to the overhead?  Yep, move it up, good.",1
"Student S, look up.",0
Bring it up.  Bring it up please.  Bring up the paper.,0
Bring it up please.,0
"Everyone else should be looking at them.  Right, Student C?",0
"Five, four, three, two, one.  All right.  Everybody back to the table.  Back to the table.  Come on back.  Come on back. Come on back.   Come back.  All right.  What are some things that you share?  I mean what are some things around the room that could be used to measure – I mean use the units or the cubes to measure something – the weight of something.  Yes?",0
"All right.  So, I am going to wait. Thanks. Student, strike one. So today we are working on order of operations. We have kind of already worked on it but we are going to take it to a higher level because you have more complex problems in the sixth grade meaning the questions will not just have three pieces; one, two and equal. So you need to figure out the order of operations; how to start and where to start. Try these two problems. I'm going to give you 2 minutes, 3 minutes to do these two problems.",0
"No, they aren't the same – this is what I said when we first started, when I first started talking, this tells me you are not listening.  This is telling me you are not listening.  I said multiplication and I already said multiplication and division are the same.  One is it's more than the other.  And if you have them as I wrote on the board, if you were writing your notes, it says multiplication and division, if they have both of them; you start from left to right; whichever one you hit first.  I said that for that and I said that for addition and subtraction.  And this was a perfect example of that.",0
"You are going to have to write the rules. So if you are finished doing the problems, Student, write the rules, Student. Because we know that Student needs personal invitations.",1
"That worked this time but as you saw last time, it doesn't always work so you can't count on that.  Look at the next one.  I am going to wait for Student and Student to stop wasting our time.",0
I continue to hear you calling out so I am ignoring you because you are ignoring the room.,1
"[Inaudible].completed the third question.  Student, you need to be on task.  Student, let me see your notebook.  Let me see your notebook, students.",0
"Okay, we are going to work with you later because you are not doing what you need to.  So please go ask Ms. Burt if you can go sit over there until I can finish.  Thank you. All right.  So let's look at the last one.  Where do I start, Student?",1
And then?  I am waiting for Student to finish,0
I am going to wait because you are all talking.,1
"If it is not math, I don't want to hear it.  You are not getting enough right to have side conversations.  And it's not just you, that is the person you are talking to as well.",1
"For the fifth time, it is written on the board.  Access the information that you are given.  Use the information that you are given so that we are not making simple mistakes.  I should not have to say rules are here anymore.  I should not have to point to them at all.",0
You may take this paper and begin.  Just that one.,0
Why?  Order of operations.  So I'm going to wait because there are several voices and you never raise your hand.  So you are off task.  Equals three.,1
"Wait – okay, sit.  Where do I start?  Where do I start?",0
Do that.  Can you not stand in front of that please?,0
Have a seat right there.,0
Somebody is guessing.  Please have a seat either at the table or on the rug.,0
"If you have 25, you may go.  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.",0
"There are four steps.  We need to start with anything that is in the parentheses is the first thing you do.  Whatever is in there, it doesn't matter what.  If it is in there, you do that first.  That's number one.  The second thing you do is when we get to exponents, you do that.  The third thing, I gave it to Student.  The third thing you are going to do is multiplication or division.  It doesn't matter.  You need to pay attention.  Half the reason you don't know what you're doing is because you are not paying attention.  And the fourth step is addition or subtraction.  Sometimes you are going to find new problems and you are going to have both.  You are going to have addition and subtraction or multiplication and division.  So the question is what do you do first?  It doesn't matter.  You can do it like a regular problem.  You go from left to right.  So whichever one you hit first is what you do.  So if you hit division first, do that first.  If you see multiplication first, you do that.  If you hit subtraction first you do that or if you hit addition first, you do that.  Do you follow me?",1
"Is that multiplication?  Look at the sign.  What are you multiplying?  This is step two, multiplication.  What is 8 times 4?  What is 4 times 8?  It is the same answer. Student, stay on task.",0
"Student, that's not appropriate.",0
Work on your multiplication because you were daydreaming.  And I am catching you staring into the bookshelf.  And what do you multiply?,0
"Do it.  Teacher?  I told her to come work on her multiplication because instead of trying, she is staring at the bookshelves.  So I am not quite sure what's going on today. Then what?",1
I am quite aware of my name so it does not require you to call it.  Have a seat.  Have a seat.,1
"She has that.  The other paperwork when I ask, go to Student’s desk.  Student?  Strike one.  You are not in your seat.",1
Have a seat.  Put it in the bin.  I don't know why you are bringing me your papers but – have a seat.  Go ahead.,0
You can put your hand down.  You don't have to sit there with your hand up.,1
