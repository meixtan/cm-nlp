There’s lots of steps involved here so you need to make sure that you’re showing your work and keeping up with it in an organized manner so you can make a little mistake in the steps a long the way and end up getting the answer wrong in the end.  Look how much math you had to do on your desk today just to work it out with your markers.  If you make one little mistake you can end up with the wrong answer.  That happened a couple of times.  Some people ended up with eight-twelfths instead of seven-twelfths and then you can’t simplify seven- twelfths.  But when they ended up with eight-twelfths they started simplifying.  So it can make a big difference.  So you have to kind of find the balance.

For example – so I have now 903 plus 102.  It's going to be 5010.  So 1,005.  I came [inaudible].  For example I have 103 plus 102.  So I have 1,005.  Look here.  My score is going to be 5.  You take away this from 1,000, because it goes to 1,000.  That's what you do.  You write 1,000 here. I'm going to have 5.  The score is 5.  Now you play.  What are you adding to each?

So this is 200 percent, or 200.  If I add this number, this number, this number and this number, if they come up to be less than 200 percent, which is 200, if it comes up less, then I know I can fit it in that bowl.  But if it turns out that these numbers add up to more, then they won’t fit.  Remember the question says, “If you made Miguel’s fruit salad, would it fit in a two-quart bowl?” Do you want to add these numbers up?

You ended up taking 9 from 4 and getting 5. This is what you said you did on the [Inaudible] which you can't do.  Can you just reverse the numbers and do 9 minus 4?  No.  This has to be a bigger number.  Where do we get that bigger number?  Over here.  We had to borrow it and it becomes a 14.  This is really 14 minus 9 is 5, okay?  Wait a minute.  I borrowed, so this became a what?  Two tens, not three tens.  That should be two tens, right?  Then you end up with 10.  Do we understand?

The only problem you forgot over here, this number is three and five tenths times 10.  Just jumble that all in there.  Three and five tenths times 10 is what?  Okay.  You need to do that, because you're messing up your decimal.  Just by messing up the decimal place you're going to get it wrong.  Everything else so far looks good.  Keep going.  Student J.

You can’t simplify it, is that what you’re saying?  Correct.  How many times can 10 go into 90?  Beautiful.  Way to go.  Good job.  Very good.  Put that marker back up for me.  So you see, this one was kind of easy.  Nine tenths, you know how to write nine tenths because we’ve done decimals, haven’t we?  A decimal then the 9.  The 9 goes in the tenths place.  That’s all you have to do.  You didn’t even have to work that one out, right?  No.  90 percent.  If there’s 10 questions on a test and you get 9 of them right, you want 9 percent or the 90 percent?  You get 90 because they’re 10 points each. All right.  We’re going to go back to that.  Hold on. You can see that there’s a relationship between our decimals and our fractions.  Four tenths in fraction form is the same as that.  We have done four tenths. Yes?  Okay.  Yes sir?",FALSE

Can we talk about it in a minute when the other group leaves?  Let’s do one more.  Thank you.  This is why you got pulled over here.  5 and 10.  We’re going to do five tenths.

Everything you need for that game is up there.  I put the dice up there.  This is all you’re doing, finding the greatest common factor and using that to divide. If you are trying to simplify a fraction, you do your greatest common factor first, then you use that to divide your numerator and denominator by.  So what would be 5 divided by 5?",FALSE

Minus one is what?,FALSE
Is that going to work for that?,FALSE
"All right, so with that being said –",FALSE
"Adding.  Or multiplying – and typically when I usually know something is increasing – or I can subtract or divide, and that is when something is decreasing, all right?  So let’s go ahead; we’re going to do a couple together and then I want you guys to work on some. So if I look at this one right here I see two, four, six, eight, and I have to think to myself, “Is it increasing or is it decreasing?”  When I look I see that this is the smaller number then this gets bigger and bigger and bigger; so I know that it’s increasing.  So if it’s increasing I start to think, “Which one of these operations is it going to be? Is it going to be adding or subtracting?”  I know that I an easily add what?",FALSE
So what would 12 plus 4 be?,FALSE
"Plus five, plus ten; is that going to work?  What’s five plus five?",FALSE
Times two.  What could I do to get from 10 to 20?,FALSE
Forty.,FALSE
Fifty divided by five is what?,FALSE
Minus two?,FALSE
"Yes, Student A, you may.  Student C, stay focused.  Student D and Student J.",TRUE
And 12 times 4 is…?,FALSE
Minus two is…?,FALSE
Okay.  So you see a shape there?  What shape do you see?,FALSE
"Well it's centimeters, so you could use, I would say, 2.8 – is that 2.8?",FALSE
So that should be a little bit smaller.  Label that so you don't forget.  What was that?  I don't even remember what that was.,FALSE
This is 6.5?,FALSE
All right.  Yeah?,FALSE
Okay.  That's fine.,FALSE
"Okay.  What did you get for this right here, Student M?",FALSE
"A big square, or a big rectangle?  You noticed that right here at the bottom?  Student N, what did you do?",FALSE
"So with that being said, can we find the area of this rectangle?",FALSE
"So using a grid in this particular instance is not a really great strategy unless you're like, really good at drawing perfectly straight lines.  Does everybody understand that? Student S, do you understand that?  Student K?",FALSE
Which one is the middle number?,FALSE
"Yes, it means to make a good guess, but we actually use rounding so that our guesses are a really good guess.  All right.  It is close to the word guess.  Don't worry about that right now.  We're just going to focus on this.  So in order to estimate, I got to the grocery store sometimes.  I try to estimate how much my bill is going to be by rounding.  So this is something you're going to use in your entire life.  I take my grocery list and I round off the price of everything to the nearest dollar.  That's the same thing you were doing these last couple of days when you were rounding to the nearest number.  I used that in the grocery store.  I round to the nearest dollar.  All right. That's what we're going to do on this paper.  Let's see if I can get this straightened a little bit.  Oh well.  Okay. Look at the very first one.  We've got one and five tenths plus one and two tenths.  So if we're trying to find the answer to an addition problem, what is that called?  Does anybody remember the answer to an addition problem? Student K?",FALSE
"Right, because it's going to stay the same.  The 1 is actually going to stay the same.  The 2 tells the 1 to stay the same.  On your paper you're going to round one and two tenths to what, Student D?",FALSE
2 and—,FALSE
That is exactly right.  If we weren't going to round it would be two and seven tenths.  Okay.  Let's look at the next one.  I want you all to go ahead and round.  Who can remind us all what would 1 and—,FALSE
"What would one and eight – Student H, tell me what one and eight tenths would round to.",FALSE
"That's right.  What is 2 minus 1?  Please tell me you know that, Student T.",FALSE
"Remember, the hundredths place is not changing anything, because you're still rounding to the nearest whole number. What will the 9 tell the 2 to do?",FALSE
Very good. One and eight tenths minus six tenths.  Very good. Go ahead.  What are we going to round the one and eight tenths to?  Student H?,FALSE
"Okay, minus what, Student W?",FALSE
"Okay.  When you have a number in the hundredths place, and it still tells you to round to the nearest whole number, that hundredths place number is not changing what you're going to do.  You're still going to look at the 9 here.  The 9 is still going to tell the 2 what to do.  It tells it to go up, so what is it going to round up to, Student R?",FALSE
"Okay, so three times two is six, which is a multiple of three, but she says buzz.  Every – every time we get to a multiple of three, you buzz.  Okay, so after six, the next number would be –",FALSE

That’s okay.  Beautiful smile.  That’s okay, Student I, I know you’re smiling inside.  Hello, Student J.  Are you finished?  Teeth, Student K.  Let me see teeth.  Okay, the number 18, we’re gonna represent 18 using some color chips on the overhead projector.  I’m gonna turn this off right now.  I’ll put it up again at the end of class if you’re not quite finished. Student I, would you get the lights, please?  Actually, turn the other light off.  Okay, if you would direct your attention to the board, I have lots of color chips up here and I’m gonna use 18 of them.  Okay, our multiplication sentence was three times six equals 18.  So I’m going to model that using the chips.  Okay, there is a row of green. How many green chips are in that row?",FALSE

How did you know it was that?,FALSE
"Good.  Could I have broken it up so I only ended up with two multiplication problems?  Student L, how did you break it up?",FALSE
"So we broke the 16 into 10 and 6, so she has 30 times 10 and 30 times 6.  Do you agree with that?",FALSE

In 47; but I think before you started this unit, I might have seen a lot of people take this equation and do this and add them up. Okay?  And I don’t see that now which I’m very happy about. So today, as you go into your multiplication work, one of the ways you might think it is to break up one of the numbers, one of the factors, okay?

But, as far as the math that goes into that, remember that we’re stretching out this number 10 times.  Alright. So one of the strategies you can use today is breaking up the number in any way.
